YUG.1.t:0 "Presidents Meet in Belgrade"
YUG.1.d:0 "Earlier today the Belgrade International Airport became the site of a news media scramble as a plane from Titograd carrying Montenegrin president Milo Đukanović unexpectedly arrived on the runway. The president, never a darling of even the state press, was quickly whisked away by his security detail. It only later emerged that he had travelled, alongside Serbian president Ivica Dačić, to the mansion of Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević in downtown Belgrade. While the nature of this meeting is still unknown to the public, it has sparked an increased concern about President Milošević’s health, as his public appearances have recently become less and less common. What isn’t difficult to speculate on however is why just these three men were included in the meeting. Đukanović and Dačić are often considered to be Milošević’s closest allies among the six republics that make up the Yugoslav federation. Đukanović in particular has been very vocal in his support of Milošević’s efforts to improve the country’s relations with the European Union of Socialist Republics. The meeting concluded late in the evening and both presidents were taken separately to their residences, with Đukanović stopping to give a short comment that ‘he and President Milošević see eye to eye on the future of Yugoslavia’."
YUG.1.o1:0 "What were they discussing?"
YUG.2.t:0 "Attacks in Kosovo"
YUG.2.d:0 "Recent reports from the autonomous province of Kosovo has seen an upsurge in attacks from separatist groups, primarily the Kosovo Liberation Army. Targets of these attacks include police stations, government buildings and sometimes lone individuals accused of crimes against the Kosovar Albanian population. This new wave of attacks follows increased ethnic tension in the area, as the government in Belgrade has made the stomping out of separatism one of its main priorities. Kosovo’s interior minister, Aleksandar Vulin, has called for increased resources to the regional government in order to carry out this objective. He has also called out both the Albanian and German governments of funding rebel groups in the area in order to gain leverage over, or to break up, Yugoslavia. These allegations have been firmly denied by both countries, sparking a minor incident where Vulin had to be ‘corrected’. However these comments have also caused an outpouring of support from Kosovar Serbs, who see Vulin as someone who stands up for their interests."
YUG.2.o1:0 "Damn Rebels!"
YUG.3.t:0 "Milošević Undergoes Treatment"
YUG.3.d:0 "Earlier this morning President Slobodan Milošević was hastily transported to a local hospital in downtown Belgrade. When the intrusive local press caught wind of the story, the doctors were quick to come out with official information. Apparently the president was tested for irregular blood pressure during his bi-monthly checkup with his personal doctor, being quickly rushed to the operating table after the results came in. Now the medical staff have announced that the president is out of surgery and has begun his recovery, assuring the nation that he’ll be able to return governing sometime later this month. The sudden nature of the operation caused a minor government crisis as regional governments were unsure who was really in power. The crisis was quickly solved however as Milošević came out of the operation and announced that prime minister Milutin Mrkonjić would serve as interim president until he can return to office."
YUG.3.o1:0 "We wish him a speedy recovery."
YUG.4.t:0 "Death of Slobodan Milošević"
YUG.4.d:0 "Tragedy has struck the nation today as Slobodan Milošević, President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, passed away early this morning. The shocking news came to the public through the late president’s personal doctor, who announced his death from the Savski Venac Medical Center. Contrary to what the public had been told earlier, it seems that Milošević’s condition did not improve after his surgery and that his health continued to decline. He ultimately suffered from a fatal heart attack during the early hours of the morning. The government has already received an outburst of sympathy from both the population and foreign dignitaries from places as diverse as the Soviet Union, the American People’s Commonwealth and the United Arab Republic. Across the nation flags have been lowered to half mast as a ten day mourning period has been declared. Yet there is also uncertainty and even fear as no one can be sure what will happen next. Though a very divisive leader, Milošević has worked to maintain the Yugoslav federation for the last 20 years. With him gone the future of the country now seems less certain. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia has already called for an extraordinary congress to elect a new president. In the meantime, prime minister Milutin Mrkonjić will continue to serve in his capacity as acting president until a new leader can be elected."
YUG.4.o1:0 "A tragedy for the entire nation."
news.303.t:0 "Death of Slobodan Milošević"
news.303.d:0 "Slobodan Milošević, President of Yugoslavia, passed away earlier this morning following a fatal heart attack. The aging Yugoslav leader had long suffered from health problems, but many expected him to recover after surgery earlier this year. His death comes at a time of particular strife and many already fear what consequences this could have for the fragile federation. Milošević has been an infamous Yugoslav politician since becoming leader of Serbia in 1989. He was in fact considered to be the de-facto leader of Yugoslavia long before being elected president. Though controversial, Milošević has often been credited with leading the country through the tumultuous Nineties, as ethnic strife threatened to tear the country apart. Now flags across Yugoslavia are lowered to half-mast and the League of Communists has called an extraordinary congress to elect a new president to succeed Milošević."
