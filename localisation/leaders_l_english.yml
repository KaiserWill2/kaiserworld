### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_HYSNI_MILLOSHI_DESC:0 "Hysni Milloshi has been an obscure figure for most of his life. He was not a politician, but a writer and poet with a low-ranking membership in the Party of Labour. He was also a loyal supporter of long-time First Secretary Enver Hoxha. Milloshi’s adherence to Hoxha’s political line brought him into conflict with Hoxha’s successor, Ramiz Alia, who had pursued a policy of measured reform in the face of mounting pressure from both inside and outside the country. What began as a public letter critical of the First Secretary soon turned into a widespread movement against reform. It catapulted Milloshi to national prominence and Alia was forced to concede to an ever growing faction of hardliners in the party. As the figurehead of the movement, Milloshi was given rising political offices, eventually becoming a member of the party’s Central Committee. After Alia’s untimely death in 2002, the party looked for a younger leader who could bring unity to the country. Eventually Hysni Milloshi was chosen as First Secretary, becoming the undisputed leader of Albania. His time in power has seen a return to the harsh authoritarianism of the Hoxha era. The small and isolated country remains economically backwards, but is kept afloat by development aid from the Warsaw Pact and the growing fear of a Yugoslav invasion, something Milloshi continues to prepare for."
POLITICS_LOUISA_HANOUNE_DESC:0 "A prominent figure within the Algerian radical socialist movement, Louisa Hanoune led numerous protests against the dictatorship that had ruled her country for decades, inspiring a nation to get behind her polarising views. While eventually the regime did come to an end, it took almost five years for Hanoune to become Workers' Party leader in 1990 and subsequently President in 1991. Since the 'Silent Revolution' as it is called in Algeria's contemporary history books, Hanoune has intertwined her party into every aspect of Algerian society, while ensuring not to establish a cult of personality around herself or any other prominent figures. Her unique revolutionary regime has inspired other movements around the world, and she remains the most powerful woman in Africa."
POLITICS_JOSE_EDUARDO_DOS_SANTOS_DESC:0 "Jose Eduardo dos Santos has served as President of Angola since the death of liberation fighter Agostinho Neto in 1979. Angola's war for independence against Portugal both inspired many in Africa, and even the home country itself, with Lisbon falling to revolutionary forces in the following years. Santos' regime has remained isolated from the world for countless decades, choosing to remain immune to 'petty international politics' that the omnipresent Soviet Union engages in. However, with his iron fist still remaining stronger than ever, the President is weakening in his resolve to keep on going, and a lack of desginated successor may prove to be the downfall of his seemingly unbeatable revolutionary party."
POLITICS_SERGIO_MASSA_DESC:0 "Sergio Massa was unknown to many in the country, until at the age of just 25 he led a revived democratic movement to bringing down a brutal socialist regime. Peronists at the time thought little of the man, but by the drafting of a new constitution in 1999, Massa had solidified his powerbase and gained powerful allies throughout the political sphere. In 2004, he won his first election to become President of Argentina, presenting himself as the savior of a new Argentina that was still lagging behind its neighbours in South America. Initially the economy improved and the people were content with their revolutionary leader remaining head of state for as long as possible, but a short-lived military coup in 2006 ended his leadership. The following year, the ruling junta collapsed due to a devastating economic crisis unfolding across the continent, leading to another restoration of true democracy. In the 2009 election, Massa won to enter his second non-consecutive term as President of Argentina."
POLITICS_HARRY_MITCHELL_DESC:0 "Harry Mitchell was Mayor of Tempe Arizona from 1978 until 1992, with a brief gap in 1988 during the Admiralty Incident. Using this as a springboard to propell his political career further, he sought the Social Renewal Party nomination in 1997, but failed to win any significant number of votes outside his home city. However, his luck would turn around in 2001 when the Social Renewal and Democratic Union parties merged to create the Social Union. Supporters of his 1997 campaign turned out in huge numbers to convince the rest of the country that this time Mitchell could unite them all. At the time, Arizona was a deeply divided nation shattered by corruption revelations and emigrants fleeing from every direction. By mid 2001, Mitchell had secured the nomination, and in November he became President of Arizona. Since inauguration in 2002 his programs of moderate welfare expansion, an enormous infrastructure endeavour and an unprecedented fight against corruption, have led to victories for the Social Union at every single national election. Whilst there are no term limits in Arizona, Mitchell seems ready to retire in time for the 2013 election, and his successor may not be so popular."
POLITICS_JULIA_GILLARD_DESC:0 "Julia Gillard has been a controversial figure in Australian politics for years, consistently using outlandish statements on the campaign trail to garner unprecedented support within disillusioned voters. Formerly a member of the defunct People's Alternative, a revolutionary socialist party, Gillard has shifted further to the right in the past thirty years, joining Labor in 1989. She was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1998, becoming Shadow Agriculture Minister in 2001. By the time of the Liberal National Coalition's collapse in 2004, she had risen to the position of Deputy Leader, and upon Labor's landslide loss to the rapidly growing Australian Conservatives in 2007, she was selected to succeed her mentor John Brumby as party leader. In a snap 2009 election, Gillard claimed an unprecedented victory, being elected Prime Minister with an overwhelming majority of seats. However, in recent months her popularity has plunged due to a worsening economic crisis and a growing rift with the Governor General. Australia's first female Prime Minister will have to battle against all odds to maintain her position until the next federal election."
POLITICS_PETER_MERTENS_DESC:0 "As a teenager in the economically shattered Belgium, Peter Mertens became an adherent of radical Marxist-Leninist thought. By the landslide national victory for Belgium's Workers' Party in 1984, Mertens had already joined the Marxistich-Leninistische Beweging, a growing force in local politics. Initially sceptical of the Workers' Party in power, he came to join their ranks after the attempted 'reactionary coup' in 1986, when he was just 17. Upon Germany's reunification and rapid Warsaw Pact expansion throughout Western Europe, Mertens sought closer alliances with those above him. Eventually in the late 1990s, he was granted his wish after gradually climbing through the ranks. Becoming Junior Politburo Member in 1997, Mertens had achieved national recognition and was slated by some as the possibly youthful successor to Secretary Ludo Martens. However, it would take another decade for Peter to lead his nation. After revolutionary Ludo's death in 2008, allies of the current Secretary moved quick to secure his place as the natural successor, purging possible opposition and rounding up all Politburo members who refused to comply with the new policies already put forward within the State Assembly. On Christmas Day, Peter Mertens became First Secretary and President of Belgium."
POLITICS_JIGME_SINGYE_WANGCHUCK_DESC:0 "Dragon King Jigme Singye Wangchuck received his education in Western institutions, from India to England. Upon his father's death, he became Dragon King in 1972, vowing to the dying head of state in earlier weeks that he would continue his legacy of democratisation and opening up of Bhutan. In the following decades, this is exactly what he did. By establishing various checks and balances and the first stages of a constitutional government, the King ushered in a new era of love between the royal family and its subjects. Since those first years the people of Bhutan have grown to not just revere, but adore their head of state, proud of the many accomplishments he has made, especially in recent years when the national gross domestic product was shown to have increased at an astonishing rate just since the early 2000s. However, at the turn of this decade there are rumours throughout Bhutan that the Dragon King is preparing to abdicate in favour of his eldest son. But an end to their beloved monarch could stoke the flames of great political change."
POLITICS_OSCAR_ZAMORA_MEDINACELI_DESC:0 "Originally a member of the Bolivian Communist Party and even founder of the Communist Youth organisation, Oscar Zamora Medinaceli split from the party in 1964. His growing connections with Chinese officials and devoted Maoists had angered many within the highest levels of party administration, and his expulsion was met by an outcry from fellow Bolivian Maoists. In 1965 he formed the Socialist Party, which eventually became the Revolutionary Left Front after another catastrophic split. However, despite the worsening situation for far left politics in Bolivia, the tide was about to turn. The recently formed socialist governments of Argentina, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay invaded Bolivia to topple the right wing dictatorship of Rene Barrientos. Their operation was successful, and Medinaceli was appointed by the occupying forces as Bolivian President. Just three years later in 1973, Argentina, Bolivia and Peru would mount another successful offensive against Pinochet's regime in Chile. Since then, President Medinaceli has ruled with an iron fist over Bolivia, demanding total allegiance from both the military and populace. However, after revolutions toppled socialist governments in Argentina, Peru and Uruguay, the situation is growing dire every year, and Bolivia could be the next to go."
POLITICS_ROMERO_JUCA_DESC:0 "President Romero Juca was once an unknown politician in the state of Roraimo, as both socialist governments and right wing dictatorships ruled Brazil for countless decades. However, when the Democratic Movement toppled the last military junta in 1987, Juca quickly rose to the top of the state's food chain, being elected Governor in 1989. His career there would not last long, being ousted by his leftist opponents in 1983. On the other hand, his failure in his home state proved to be the greatest opportunity of Juca's life, being called to the capital for a personal meeting with Itamar Franco. This exchange solidified his growing powerbase within national politics, as prominent figures grew to like his populist tone and the fiery debates he had conducted in Roraima. By 2006 he was elected leader of the Democratic Movement, and in 2007 won his first nationwide election to became the President of Brazil. Ending more than a decade of leftist national government, Juca is seen as the savior of centrist politics, but has gradually leaned to the left in recent years to appease disgruntled voters across Brazil."
POLITICS_ALEKSANDER_PAUNOV_DESC:0 "Aleksander Paunov was a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party's academic faction before his rise to power. As a junior member of the State Council, he frequently conflicted with the opinions of fellow members, but always ensured total loyalty to General Secretary Todor Zhivkov. When longtime leader Zhivkov died in 1998, his close friend Petar Mladenov succeeded him in the renamed office of People's Secretary, but would himself fall to illness in late 1999 and die. At this point the Communist Party old guard were struggling to maintain control, and the threat of a popular uprising against their stagnating government was all too real for most. Eventually, they decided the younger 50-year old Aleksander Paunov, now Deputy Advisor to Bulgaria's State Council, should become their paramount leader for the coming millennium. After being sworn in on the 1st of January 2000, Paunov orchestrated a devastating purge throughout the country. In just one year, his ruthlessness became the face of the Warsaw Pact, strengthening the resolve of other allied leaders and showing to Europe's disgruntled populace that their disobedience would be met with the harshest consequences. By 2003, Paunov secured total control over Bulgaria and the last remnants of the old guard were wiped out. Seen by many as the most tyrannical leader in the Warsaw Pact, Aleksander Paunov is certainly one to be feared, and shows no signs of retiring from his office any time soon."
POLITICS_BOKASSA_II_DESC:0 "Born as Jean-Serge Bokassa, the current Emperor of Central Africa became a Prince with the style Imperial Highness in 1976. After avoiding a possibly disasterous military coup in 1979, the head of state grew increasingly paranoid and weary of his closest advisors and even family members. By the late 1980s he had sidelined many within the Imperial Court, and ensured a clear line of succession within the family so no one would dare to remove him from power. Nevertheless, when he attempted to commit suicide in 1994 via drug overdose, his younger son but designated heir apparent Jean-Bedel Bokassa Jr. attempted to seize control. The suicide attempt failed and Emperor Bokassa was furious that his son would disobey his wishes, subsequently executing his heir and all those who declared loyalty to him during the 'coup'. After this incident, the Emperor chose a son and cabinet minister he formerly called 'weak', Jean-Serge Bokassa to succeed him as head of state. The new Crown Prince diligently waited for his father to die, and eventually he did in a plane crash above Sudan, just hours before New Years Day 1996. For 14 years, Bokassa II has reigned over the Empire, making numerous efforts to reform and democratise many aspects of the nation. However, while the economy is being decentralised and ministerial posts are being given more powers, the House of Bokassa still remains the sole legal and 'holy' leadership of Central Africa."
POLITICS_PRESTON_MANNING_DESC:0 "Preston Manning, a champion of conservative and populist values common to the West of Canada, founded and led the Reform Party of Canada to many victories in both provincial and federal elections from 1987 to 1998 following the American collapse. For a time, it appeared that the Reform Party was on course to upset the PCs as the major conservative force in the country after Brian Mulroney's disastrous premiership resulted in an NDP landslide in 1989. However, the stabilisation period after America's demise and NATO's collapse led to mainstream parties experiencing an enormous resurgence, especially Joe Clark's revitalized Progressive Conservatives. After a devastating loss at the 2000 election, Manning resigned as party leader, and subsequently dissolved Reform. For many years he retired from politics to become simply a footnote in Canada's history, failing to gain enough seats to govern even at his party's height. However, when the Liberal Party became mired by the biggest corruption scandal in Canadian history, Manning was inspired by his loyal followers to once again rejoin the political arena and take down the corrupt establishment figures. In 2003, Manning officially joined Peter MacKay's Progressive Conservatives, and after the MacKay government fell to New Democrats in 2006, he was seen as a clear candidate to restore a conservative vision to Canada. Less than a month after the election, PC members elected him as their next party leader, believing he could turn back the center-left tide and bring true populism back to the forefront of Canadian politics. In 2008, the party won by a landslide, with the Canadian people electing Preston Manning to become Prime Minister."
POLITICS_DANIEL_ORTEGA_DESC:0 "Initially 'Coordinator of the Junta of National Reconstruction', Daniel Ortega has led Nicaragua and subsequently Central America since 1975. After training with Cuban forces in guerilla warfare, the revolutionary returned to his home nation to fight against the Somoza presidential dynasty. By 1974 the tide had turned against the dictatorship, and Orteg'a forces seized complete control in late 1975. When the constitutional convention was cancelled, the international community expressed dismay, believing that the Sandinista Front would restore real democracy in Nicaragua. Despite their grievances, the socialist junta continued until a suitable civilian administration could be put in place. After fighting against a right wing rebellion in the mid-1980s, President Ortega finally made concessions and dissolved the Junta to officially become President. From this day forward he worked tirelessly to unite Central America under one government, leading resistance forces in neighbouring nations to victory against their respective right wing dictatorships. In 1997, the Socialist Republic of Central America was established with Ortega as its sole head of state, advocating for a centralised government rather than the federal alternatives of the past. Since then, no opposition against the President has gained any power, and the various rebels that remain across the country are weakening by the day. It seems Ortega will rule until he dies."
POLITICS_JOHN_CHIANG_DESC:0 "After the death of Chiang Kai-shek, his son Chiang Ching-kuo became President of the Chinese Republic, continuing his father's authoritarian rule. However, during his rule from 1975 to 1988 the government inevitably opened itself up to political dissident and the establishment of powerful opposition within the country. Freedom of speech was enshrined in various laws and demonstrations against government policy were once again permitted for the first time in decades. Upon his own death, the grandson of Chiang Kai-shek won a power struggle to succeed him. While the former President's deputy Lee Teng-hui was slated to become his successor, there were still many within the Republic that demanded a presidential bloodline to last for decades onwards. A driving force behind this movement was the military, which stood alongside the late President's son Chiang Hsiao-yen in his bloody coup against the short-lived bensheng ren administration. In just two days Acting President Lee Teng-hui was murdered as well as a significant portion of the Executive Yuan. Eventually, the illegitimate son came out on top as China's victorious ruler, consolidating his power over the following years. Since those turbulent times the island nation has come to hate their President, and his own advisors are drifting away."
POLITICS_ISABEL_ALLENDE_DESC:0 "In 1970, Salvador Allende was elected President of Chile, adopting a policy of nationalisation and collectivisation. His national leadership however was short-lived, when a military coup led by Augusto Pinochet removed him from office and exiled his family to Mexico. Advised by the Soviet Union and other socialist parties in the Americas, the radical left regimes of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru successfully invaded Pinochet's Chile and executed him upon the surrender of his capital forces. Only a month after the initial military coup, Allende's family had returned to the country, with former First Lady Hortensia Bussi appointed head of state by the occupying powers. She would remain leader of the Socialist Party for fourteen years, gradually reconstructing the country and restoring the people's faith in their government. When she was assassinated in 1987, Chile was breifly governed by four different Presidents over the space of just three years. The chaos resulting from this party instability led to a military intervention. Once the dust had settled and allies of the former President had been arrested, the daughter of Salvador, Isabel Allende was elected President by the recently convened Emergency National Assembly. Since 1990, she has ruled Chile democratically, winning every election since, but many in the international community have begun to question the legitimacy of many of these electoral results."
POLITICS_HENG_SAMRIN_DESC:0 "Heng Samrin became Chairman of the Revolutionary Council in 1979, after a Vietnamese invasion of the infamous Democratic Kampuchea, controlled by the Khmer Rouge. In 1981 his powers were increased, ascending to the office of General Secretary. Since the final years of the Vietnamese occupation, Kampuchea has been entirely independent from its neighbouring communist nation, and Samrin has led an effort to ensure that no other nations attempt to interfere in internal politics again. An attempted assassination of the General Secretary in 2007 left him badly injured, but he appears to have recovered since then. However, many within the Salvation Front are worried that their revolutionary leader is growing tired of the job and may not be in the best shape to run a country."
POLITICS_JUAN_MANUEL_SANTOS_DESC:0 "Juan Manuel Santos has been an influential politician in Colombia for decades, holding key positions within various governments. A member of the wealthy Santos family, which is alleged to illegally run almost all of Colombia's major media sectors, Juan Manuel worked his way up the ladder during the 1990s. His ability to create 'impossible deals' endeared him to many in the Colombian political sphere, but also made him a lot of enemies. By 2002, President Alvaro Uribe appointed him Vice President, hoping for the older man to succeed him in later years. However, in 2006 their relationship had soured and Santos secretly leaked incriminating evidence against his former friend and the head of state. The President however refused to accept fault, resulting in a stunning move from the Vice President. In 2007 he resigned from his post and formed a new party, taking three quarters of the leader's party with him. With the Congress of Colombia now firmly against President Uribe, he was impeached in a historic vote, and a snap election was held to decide a successor to Acting President Roy Barreras. The people subsequently voted overwhelmingly for Santos, who became President not long after. Since then he has remained a controversial figure in Colombian politics, from his betrayal of a former ally and close friend, to the deep connections his family has with money and media."
POLITICS_HANS_MODROW_DESC:0 "Hans Modrow’s career in the Socialist Unity Party stretches across many decades, beginning in the Free German Youth. His party connections allowed him to study in both Moscow and Berlin, graduating with a doctorate in economics. Over the years he served in several positions, joining the Volkskammer and the Central Committee, heading the department of agitation and eventually becoming first secretary of the SED in Dresden. He was one of the few party members that dared to openly criticize General Secretary Erich Honecker. Because of this he was prevented from rising further in the party and the Stasi hounded him for any evidence of treason. Yet he also developed important contacts in the Soviet Union, positioning himself as a future leader in the eyes of Moscow. Honecker was eventually encouraged to resign in 1990, his offices divided along the principles of collective leadership. Former Stasi second-in-command Markus Wolf came to dominate this new government, leading the brutal integration of Austria and suppression of dissent across southern Germany. Modrow, now the leading reformist in the SED, was made finance minister and oversaw the continued automation of the former West German economy. When Premier Wolf died in 2006, Modrow was unanimously chosen as the new head of government. Despite the relative ease of his election, Modrow soon came under fire from rival factions in the SED. Promising political reform but being unable to produce anything but cosmetic changes, he now finds himself isolated as his political rivals come ever closer to unseating him."
POLITICS_GIORGIO_NAPOLITANO_DESC:0 "Since his entry into the Congress of Deputies in 1953, Giorgio Napolitano has been a leading member of the Italian Communist Party’s right-wing. His reformist views would often put him at odds with General Secretary Enrico Berlinguer. Despite being a moderate, he would develop a close relationship with Moscow as head of international relations for the party, in contrast with Berlinguer’s more antagonistic stance. In 1984 the PCI became the first communist party in Western Europe to win a democratic election. In the wake of this victory it was Berlinguer who called on Napolitano to help form a coalition with the Italian Socialist Party, something Napolitano had long advocated. His success was rewarded with a position in Berlinguer’s government as foreign minister, yet it wouldn’t last long. The General Secretary’s death only months later paved the way for Napolitano himself to become head of the government and leader of the party. With a majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, the PCI began reforming the Italian government and economy in preparation for a transition to socialism. This culminated in the constituent assembly of 1985 that declared Italy a one-party socialist state. Gradual nationalization continued until the early 2000s, when the state held almost complete control over the economy. Despite criticism from both the left and right, Napolitano has built one of the richest and freest nations in the Warsaw Pact, and he diligently continues this work despite his old age."
POLITICS_MOHAMMED_MORGAN_DESC:0 "Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan started out as the personal bodyguard of General Siad Barre, the military strongman who, in 1969, seized power in Somalia and established a Marxist-Leninist state. Though General Barre initially relied almost entirely on the military for support, the disastrous Ogaden War of 1977-1978 led to a purge of the army and an attempted coup. He instead turned to the loyal men around him like Morgan, who was promoted to commander in Mogadishu and married to Barre’s daughter. Morgan would then lead the most elite forces in the Somali National Army, becoming known as the ‘Butcher of Hargeisa’ for his violent suppression of separatism in Somaliland. He was made Minister of Defense in 1990 and ultimately Commander-in-Chief later that same year, cementing his position as General Barre’s successor. When the ‘Victorious Leader’ died five years later Morgan took his place as president of Somalia after a power struggle with Barre’s son. Though he was known as a ruthless commander, Morgan’s rule began with some measured reforms to the state. He loosened the harsh restrictions imposed by General Barre and re-established ties with Ethiopia in a bid to gain outside support for his campaign against armed insurgents. Despite this, opposition towards his regime is widespread and much of the country is still ruled by rebel groups, disloyal generals, and uncooperative politicians."
POLITICS_IULIAN_VLAD_DESC:0 "General Iulian Vlad spent almost the entirety of the Cold War climbing the ranks of the Romanian military. He began in 1951 at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and ultimately became head of the Department of State Security in 1987. As the leader of one of the most prolific secret police forces in the Warsaw Pact, his power was rivalled only by President Nicolae Ceausescu himself. As such he became the president’s right-hand man, harshly persecuting anyone who dared to dissent against the government. When Ceausescu died in 1996, the party followed his succession plans and elected his son Nicu as president. But the young Ceausescu cared little for the duties of the office, despite his father’s tutoring, and the task of running the state increasingly fell on Vlad. Meanwhile the party grew disgruntled at being represented by a known alcoholic who spent millions of state funds on gambling, parties and unsuccessful projects. Nicu would eventually fall victim to his own vices and die in 2002, leaving the party without an official successor. Already being the de-facto leader of the country, Iulian Vlad was chosen as the next General Secretary and elected president. Despite his pledges of upholding the legacy of the 'Genius of the Carpathians', his time as leader of Romania has seen a slow move away from the excesses of the Ceausescu era, reducing the role of the personality cult, reintroducing austerity and moving the country towards a more mainstream form of communism."
POLITICS_DMITRY_YAZOV_DESC:0 "When asking about the most powerful man in the world, the answer will always resoundingly be Dmitry Yazov. Joining the Red Army during the Great Patriotic War in 1941 at age 17, Dmitry Yazov’s service to the Soviet Union has lasted for almost 70 years. Rising first throughout the ranks of the army, and then of the party, Yazov has brought a military demeanour with him into power in 1993, after Grigory Romanov passed away. Dmitry Yazov is regarded as the leader of the Military Clique, an influential faction of military leaders and officials from the Military-Industrial Complex within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Despite leading the singular world superpower for seventeen years, Yazov’s rule has not seen many improvements to the Soviet people. Corruption has risen, the economy has stagnated, and unrest has been on the rise within multiple Soviet Socialist Republics. Nevertheless, Yazov is regarded as a stable ruler, particularly when compared to his predecessor, and so long as he remains in charge, it is expected that the Soviet Union will keep trudging ever onwards towards the lofty promises of Communism."
POLITICS_ANNE_GRETE_HOLMSGAARD_DESC:0 "Anne Grete Holmsgaard is a long time member of the Left Socialist Party, the governing party of Denmark since 1983. Joining the now defunct Folketing as a MP in 1979 as part of the general surge attained by the Left Socialists, Anne Grete Holmsgaard was instrumental in shaping the foreign policy of the young Danish Socialist Republic from the early 80s and onwards. Cycling out due to the rotation principle of the Left Socialists in 1986, Holmsgaard returned to the halls of power after the 1991 elections, now as a senior figure within the party. And when former president Søren Kolstrup retired after the 2001 elections, Holmsgaard was elected President by the People’s Assembly despite grumbling from the MPs associated with the ‘public solidarity organisations’, a term for the half of parliament seats assigned to the trade unions, farmers’ associations and student unions. Since then, Holmsgaard’s presidency has been marked by stable economic growth, with a rise in exports, not just to Denmark’s usual trade partners but also to the Warsaw Pact, as Holmsgaard has rekindled Denmark’s ties to the European Union and Germany in particular, to the cheers of the Communist Party and the chagrin of the still sizable anti-Soviet faction within the Left Socialists. However, it has also been marked with a streak of antisemitism, typically uncharacteristic for Danish politics, with a malign rhetoric towards the small Jewish minority from the President. As Holmsgaard is entering her sixties, some are wondering whether the aging stateswoman is soon to retire, come the 2011 General Election. "
POLITICS_OYSTEIN_MEIER_JOHANNESSEN_DESC:0 "Hailing from Northern Norway, Øystein Meier Johannessen’s political ambitions could not be contained in the small municipality where he began his career. Shortly before the pivotal 1985 election he founded the Society Party, based on the principles of humanism and anarchism. This party achieved little success and Johannessen quickly moved to support the newly-elected socialist government of Erling Folkvord, becoming one of the prime minister’s most loyal supporters. The government soon found itself divided between the younger socialists who sought to preserve the parliamentary system and the hardline Maoists that had formed the basis of the Red Alliance. As the old guard left to join the Communist Party, Johannessen drew up his plans to keep the opposition from ousting the government come the next election. The Storting was to be elected by an electoral college chosen by the municipalities, where the socialists held large majorities. This system has kept the Red Alliance in power for over two decades, winning Johannessen both praise and criticism. Johannessen continued moving up the ranks while secretly amassing power for himself. In 1992 he succeeded in calling a leadership election which forced Folkvord to resign, paving the way for Johannessen to seize the premiership. In contrast to his earlier anarchist beliefs, Johannessen has continued to consolidate power around himself, strengthening and then assuming the office of the president in 1997. As his rule becomes more authoritarian and arbitrary, many are doubting whether he is mentally fit to serve as leader of Norway. As opposition from both within and without continues to grow, one thing remains certain; Johannessen is not planning on giving up power willingly."
POLITICS_RICHARD_SPENCER_DESC:0 "In only twenty years, Richard Spencer has risen from a young university student to one of the most beloved and powerful men among the American far-right. Spencer was already a staunch nationalist conservative during his stay in the University of Virginia, where he continually bucked the societal trends of the People's Commonwealth. Spencer, discontent with socialist programs, left university life in 2001 to pursue a political career in right-wing politics. There, in the Virginia political scene, he connected with the National Alliance, one of the most prominent far-right terrorist organizations in the American People's Commonwealth following their expulsion from Great Falls, Montana. Anti-Covington political figures there instructed Spencer in the ways of revolutionary, hardline neo-nazism, contributing to the radicalization of his already conservative views. Following the death of Pierce, the Alliance's leader, in mid-2002, Spencer journeyed to Montana, where he joined dissident groups within Covington's patchwork coalition. Following his own expulsion in 2003, Spencer, who had already built up a minor coalition of his own, took his militia group and seized the city of Spokane, as far from Great Falls as could be, in order to start a true political revolution. Although he expected little to follow his revolt, built around his own bizarre "White emancipationist" political views, thousands rallied to the young officer's banner, under a staunch anti-capitalist, anti-communist, and white supremacist program. After a long and bloody conflict, Spencer's Union finally has independence, although the unity of his own patchwork coalition remains to be seen."
POLITICS_HAROLD_COVINGTON_DESC:0 "Hundreds of thousands worship the fascist systems of the Northwest, praising the liberation of white Americans, but few of them mention Harold Covington, the Northwest's liberator, in anything but a negative light. Following disbarment from the army and deportation from Rhodesia, his adopted white homeland, Harold Covington founded the idea of the Northwest Territorial Imperative, a white nationalist homeland in the American northwest. The ideal was supported by numerous organizations across the region, the most powerful being Richard Butler's Aryan Nations and Robert Jay Matthews' The Order. Following the Great Collapse of 1987, Covington, Butler, and Matthews were among the first to establish a legitimate white nationalist government in the region, its seat in Montana. The father of the Imperative, Covington, became the first leader of Montana, and thousands of white nationalists flocked to a new homeland for their endangered people. Following the death of Jay Matthews in late 1989 in his quest to secure Western Cascadia and fully unify the Imperative, many began to point fingers at Covington for the loss, and his popularity dwindled. By the mid-1990s, Covington was forced to expel prominent leaders such as his premier opponent, William Luther Pierce, and strengthen his alliance with Aryan Nations and nationalist militias to compensate, actions that sparked mass anger among hardline fascists. Eventually, he faced a hardline political revolution by Richard Spencer, a charismatic young officer who commandeered a mutiny in Spokane, Washington, and lost most of his territory and support in the resulting carnage.

POLITICS_BILL_HAMMONS_DESC:0 "There is no man who has eroded the power and influence of his own office more than Bill Hammons. Manager of the campaign of Democratic Coalition founding father and subsequent President of the Midwest, Wesley Clark, Hammons was credited for the broad, grassroots, and centrist appeal of the popular military general's election in 2003. Guiding the campaigns of the Democratic Coalition across the country through "Runners for Clark", Hammons brought the party great victories in local and congressional elections, providing a decentralized alternative to local populations fearful of government overreach in their own affairs. When Clark expressed his desire not to seek re-election as President in 2007, Hammons was seen as the likely successor, and hastily maneuvered his way through the party leadership process. Despite the Democratic Coalition's landslide victory in 2007, the party remains deeply fractured between conservative and liberal wings, and Hammons has been categorized as someone who has only served to exacerbate tensions by standing firmly in the middle. Following the resurgence of the American Restorationist Party under hawkish conservative Hillary Rodham and the mutiny of liberals to the social-democratic Party of Hope, Hammons' base of support has steadily eroded, even among General Wesley Clark, his old benefactor. He has not yet declared his intention to run again in 2011, with public opinion low except in the most decentralized of regions, and many suspect he will open the Democratic Coalition to yet another factional struggle."
POLITICS_TOSHIO_TAMOGAMI_DESC:0 "General Toshio Tamogami has had a long and distinguished career in the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. Beginning in 1971, he eventually rose to become Commander-in-Chief of the Air Defense Command in 2004. Though he wasn’t a politician, he affiliated himself with Nippon Kaigi, an influential nationalist organisation with ties to both the political and financial sectors of Japanese society. Being known as an outspoken nationalist, Tamogami gained the attention of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who appointed him chief of staff of the Air Self-Defense Forces in 2007. At the time it seemed that Tamogami had reached the height of his career, but that was proved wrong when Shinzo Abe suddenly resigned the very same year. His resignation triggered a long political crisis which culminated in the indecisive Liberal Democratic Party leadership election of 2008. The party factions were deadlocked, unable to agree on a single candidate for the party leadership. That was until a private deal was struck between several factions who agreed to support a compromise candidate: General Tamogami. He hesitated at first, but eventually agreed and resigned his position in the army, joining the LDP and accepting the nomination. For many the old general is seen as a breath of fresh air, but the factionalism that led to his nomination still threatens the party. The government and economy is in dire need of reform and Tamogami will have to contend with the career politicians who see him as a temporary measure rather than a capable leader for Japan in the modern age."
POLITICS_LI_ZHANSHU_DESC:0 "Hailing from the rural regions of the Hebei Province, Li Zhanshu joined the Chinese Communist Party during the height of the Cultural Revolution. Beginning in 1975 he methodically worked his way up from an ordinary party functionary to the provincial leadership, but in 1997 a conflict within the government led Zhanshu to be politically marginalized. The following year he left his home province to take up the regional leadership in Shaanxi, becoming known for his efficient economic planning and modernizing vision in Xi’an. In 2003 he was transferred to the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, becoming the new governor four years later. That same year the Chinese Communist Party took a drastic turn at the 17th National Congress, when the party adopted a plan for economic liberalization endorsed by the aging Chairman Li Peng. Serving as a member of the Central Committee, Zhanshu vocally endorsed the call for reforms. His economic expertise had made him one of the candidates to succeed Li Peng as chairman, and he wasted no time ingratiating himself with the party leadership. Zhanshu’s eventual succession to the position of chairman was confirmed at the congress and he wasted no time appointing economic planners and reforming the bureaucracy in order to prepare for economic liberalization. The reforms officially came into effect in 2009, to great results. But his shakeup of the party has also given rise to an unruly group of reformists centered around his old associate Xi Jinping. The Chairman must walk a fine line between radical reformers and Maoist hardliners while ensuring that economic progress continues steadily and control is maintained by the party."
POLITICS_KIM_JONG_IL_DESC:0 "Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il is perhaps one of the most mysterious leaders in the modern world. Little is known about his early life, even where he was born. Korean sources say it was on Paektu Mountain on the border with China, other sources say it was in a Siberian military camp. He was four years old when the Second World War ended and Japanese troops withdrew from Korea. His father, Kim Il-sung, soon became premier of the newly established Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The young Kim then moved to Pyongyang and began his education just before the outbreak of the Korean War. The communist victory in the war allowed the elder Kim to consolidate power as the ‘Great Leader’ at the center of an intense cult of personality. Kim Jong-il was brought into this personality cult and by the time of the 6th Party Congress in 1980 had secured his position as heir apparent to his father, with senior positions in both the government and military. He began to consolidate power, securing the loyalty of the army and centralizing authority around himself. When his father died in 1994 Kim was prepared to succeed him as the new Supreme Leader of Korea. His first years in power saw the already authoritarian state grow even more autocratic. The economy suffered due to mismanagement, but close reliance on food imports from the USSR prevented starvation. After having secured his power, Kim brought about a slight opening of the country, lessening economic control and restrictions on personal freedom. His longtime fascination with culture and film allowed him to take an active role in the country’s entertainment industry, which saw a renaissance under Kim. Now the aging Supreme Leader has largely withdrawn from public life, causing speculation if he is even still alive. The Korean government assures the public that all is fine, but in the absence of a successor, the country risks falling into the hands of an ambitious family member, or even worse - the Korean People’s Army."
POLITICS_JEAN_LUC_MELENCHON_DESC:0 "Once a prominent young leader of the socialist left, Jean-Luc Mélenchon was one of the early advocates of a union between his party and the communists. When Georges Marchais became president in 1985, Mélenchon was quick to call for a special congress where the Socialist Party ultimately decided to merge with the triumphant communists. His efforts were recognized by the leadership with a position in the National Council. Now a leading voice of the party’s moderates and reformers, Mélenchon was dragged into a bitter power struggle with communist hardliners as the economy spiraled out of control. He became a vocal opponent of General Secretary Maxime Gremetz, who led a vicious anti-union campaign to stabilize and control the economy. But Mélenchon could not be coerced, demoted or marginalized. As new general secretaries came and went every other year, Mélenchon started to look more like a stabilizing figure. The political struggles took their toll on the economy and the nation as a whole. As a desperate last measure the 2007 Party Congress adopted a broad program of reform alongside electing Jean-Luc Mélenchon as their new general secretary. His government has carried out sweeping changes to the French political system, opening up the party, loosening restrictions on trade unions and removing many old guard politicians from power in favor of young reformers. Many of these actions go far beyond what the party expected and now many are calling for his removal. Meanwhile the economy is still stagnant and unrest is growing among the population, dissatisfied with the pace of reforms."
POLITICS_RESZO_NYERS_DESC:0 "Rezső Nyers was one of the leading members of the Social Democratic Party in post-war Hungary. In 1948 the party caved under the increasing pressure of the occupying Soviet forces and merged with the communists to form the Hungarian Working People’s Party. As a former social democrat, Nyers was viewed with suspicion by many communists, despite serving as a member of the party leadership. With the rise of János Kádár to the position of General Secretary, Nyers was appointed to the Central Committee and chosen to head the Ministry of Finance. There he drew up an economic reform package known as the New Economic Mechanism, which introduced some market forces into the Hungarian socialist economy. But the reforms were counteracted by the orthodox marxists in the party and Nyers lost his political prominence for several decades. It wasn’t until the death of János Kádár in 1989 when Nyers returned to power in the moderate government of Károly Grósz. Advocating smaller changes to the political system, Grósz was soon outpaced by the many radical reformers he promoted during his time in power. When he died in 1996 the reformers held almost complete control over the government, with Rezső Nyers becoming the next General Secretary. Despite being the oldest leader in the Warsaw Pact, Nyers’ government has been energetic in its promotion of system change. His economic reforms have led to a burgeoning free market of small businesses across Hungary. But he still has to contend with a growing faction of hardliners who accuse him of not wanting to simply reform the socialist system, but to jettison it entirely."
POLITICS_FREDERIK_WILLEM_DE_KLERK_DESC:0 "Born to a leading Afrikaaner family with long standing connections to the National Party, Frederik Willem de Klerk was exposed to politics from a young age. He was only 12 years old when the apartheid system was institutionalized by the government. His father, Johannes de Klerk, was one of its principal architects. “F. W.” de Klerk originally pursued a career as a lawyer before being persuaded to run for office for the Nationals. In the House of Assembly he established a reputation as a formidable debater and took up a number of roles in the party and government. He became known as one of South Africa’s leading conservatives and proponents of white minority rule. In 1989 while de Klerk served as Minister of Education, State President P.W. Botha suddenly resigned as party leader. Despite not being a member of the president’s inner circle, de Klerk was elected the new leader. Half a year later he succeeded Botha to the position of president as well. With the collapse of the United States and NATO, South Africa became even more isolated than before. De Klerk still refused to make any concessions to rebel groups like the African National Congress, which were seen as Soviet proxies. The ANC and their allies thus intensified their attacks against the government. The nineties saw the bloodiest years of the South African Border War, as the government fought rebel groups across the border into Angola and Zambia while cracking down on separatists in South West Africa. Much of the country was put under martial law and a state of emergency was declared, with de Klerk’s term extended indefinitely. The aging president still maintains support among the placated white and colored populations, but the majority of black South Africans who oppose the exclusionary government have begun to turn to even more radical and violent groups, bent on overthrowing the apartheid system by any means necessary."
POLITICS_ROBERT_MUGABE_DESC:0 "Robert Mugabe was an early activist for independence and majority rule in the British colony of Southern Rhodesia. He was a member of multiple African nationalist organisations, including the African National Congress, the Zimbabwe African People’s Union and ultimately the Zimbabwe African National Union, which he became the leader of. He led the ZANU forces against both the white minority government and the rival ZAPU forces in what became known as the Rhodesian Bush War. Though he was held as a prisoner for over a decade, Mugabe continued the fight after being released in 1974. The war was brought to an end by the Lancaster House Agreement in 1979, which established the process for a transition to majority rule through an election in 1980. Mugabe’s ZANU won the election in a landslide amidst widespread voter intimidation and violence. Though ideologically an African nationalist and a Marxist-Leninist, Mugabe sought reconciliation during his first years in power. But this took a sharp turn as economic difficulties enveloped the country amidst the collapse of capitalism in the west. As most white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa they became a target of the government alongside supporters of ZAPU, mostly ethnic Ndebele. As his forces carried out targeted attacks against minority communities, Mugabe’s former allies in the Soviet Union quickly distanced themselves from him while increasing aid to their allied ZAPU fighters. Mugabe in turn abandoned any notion of being a marxist, instead adopting an ideology of Zimbabwean nationalism. Now his country is isolated, with Soviet proxies to the north and apartheid South Africa to the south. But the struggle for liberation continues as long as the Father of Zimbabwe leads the nation."
POLITICS_MATTHEW_FESTING_DESC:0 "Prince and Grand Master Matthew Festing hails from a family with a long tradition of military service. His father was Sir Francis Festing, Field Marshal and Chief of Staff of the British Armed Forces in the early days of the Cold War. Matthew Festing followed in his father’s footsteps, serving in the British army and reaching the rank of colonel before joining the Knights of Malta in 1977. When the Order was exiled from Rome in 1984 he quickly set out to help rebuild the order on the island of Malta. There he led the efforts to rebuild and expand the Order’s Military Corps, working closely with his fellow Englishman, Grand Master Andrew Bertie. The socialist government of Malta remained sceptical of the Knights, but were unable to stop their expansion. After long negotiations the Knight’s Corps were ultimately made a division in the Maltese military, forging closer ties between Festing and the high command. In 1997 he took his perpetual vows, becoming a Knight of Justice and positioning himself as the heir apparent of the old Grand Master. When Bertie died in 2008, Festing was elected his successor at a conclave held in the historical Fort St. Angelo, now once again the seat of the Order. Determined to restore the power of the Knights, Festing used dissatisfaction with the government among the military to launch a coup, deposing the prime minister and taking control of the island. The Order seeks to turn Malta into a new Papal State, but without popular support they cannot hope to keep their hold of the country for long." 
POLITICS_DONALD_RUMSFELD_DESC:0 "Once a lowly national security advisor in the Reagan and then Bush administrations, Donald Rumsfeld first rose to prominence in the American Republic with his election as Vice President to George Bush in 1994. Moderate conservatives under the banner of the Independence Union and Democratic Party remnants failed to defeat the ticket, and together, Bush and Rumsfeld perfected the authoritarian nationalist system that has now led to complete Republican political dominance. Bush, however, did not follow interventionism as staunchly as his vice president, and the two began to spar over America's role in the world - Rumsfeld desired intervention in the world's conflicts, even with only America's South in their control, while President Bush desired economic stability above all. When Bush died of a heart attack in 2001, Rumsfeld soon succeeded him as president, and it is said that the rally-round-the-flag effect that occurred saved his political career. After Rumsfeld defeated George Bush Jr. in the primaries, he easily bested the Democratic Party remnants and the Independence Union, securing further control for the Republican Party. Throughout his 8-year term, Rumsfeld has pursued global interventionism, but has been criticized for failing to heal the economic collapse facing the nation since the so-called Flight of the Executives. His disastrous intervention in Yemen, which established an unstable conservative government has shattered his standing among much of the Bush Cult, and although he remains popular, Rumsfeld does not enjoy nearly the support as the elder Bush. President Rumsfeld will run again in 2010 according to all known metrics, but it is unsure if the Republicans will allow him and his hawkish agenda to survive the next election."

She soon become a brash advocate for women's rights, progressivism, and Wellstone's signature campaign promise - a centralized republic with clear protections for civil rights. In 2005, Hortman was originally expected to run for a third term, and secure herself as a prominent representative, but instead, she decided to run for President. Wellstone had refused to run a second term, citing concerns over multiple sclerosis, and the party scrambled to find new candidates. When expected frontrunner Tom Vilsack was damaged by Wellstone publicly condemning his moderate views and inability to appeal to minority, progressive voters, the nomination process was shaken even more. Hortman, a dark-horse candidate, secured the nomination after 8 grueling rounds of convention voting. She won in 2005 by a clear majority and was elected again in 2009 by a slimmer one. Her unexpected dominance over the political system has led to outcry from nationalist groups, who decry her as an authoritarian, but also progressive groups within her own party, who label her a member of a new political establishment."
POLITICS_MIKE_LEAVITT_DESC:0 "The descendant of a Mormon pioneer, Mike Leavitt served as a businessman and political advisor to his father, a state senator, before entering politics as a presidential nominee. Since he first ran for political office in 1992 as a Republican, President Mike Leavitt has lost as many presidential primaries as he has won, with challenges in '92 and '96 against John Huntsman Sr. and Orrin Hatch, respectively, both fizzling out before he won his first election in 2004. Following the popular Hatch's decision not to run again, Leavitt triumphed against a crowded field of candidates, and has now overseen record economic growth in the hermit republic and has successfully defended against aggression from both the north and west. Fortunately for his presidential aspirations, post-collapse Utah has also seen the infiltration and collapse of the Utah Democratic Party in the wake of a LaRouchite takeover. As Orrin Hatch established United Utah, a coalition against all forms of socialist and nationalist subversion, former Democrats chief among them, Leavitt became one of its founding and most influential members. Although they remain tense, Leavitt has continued Hatch's concilatory policies towards the Church of Latter Day Saints. Many fear that the president in Salt Lake City is controlled by a different president - the one of the Mormon church. As future elections approach, United Utah seems very likely to secure victory, but many in the party leadership have grown fearful of LDS President Thomas Monson's influence over Leavitt. Whether he can keep his position remains to be seen."
POLITICS_CZESLAW_KISZCZAK_DESC:0 "As the right-hand man of General Wojciech Jaruzelski, Czesław Kiszczak rose to power following a wave of protests in the autumn of 1993. Weary of Soviet influence over the Polish government, thousands of protestors took to the streets after the death of Grigory Romanov and his succession by Dmitry Yazov. The longtime civilian government was replaced by military rule and martial law was imposed. Kiszczak helped facilitate the crackdown in his role as minister of the interior, then served as a member of the Military Council of National Salvation, Poland’s de-facto government. The clampdown was harsh by Warsaw Pact standards and served to alienate much of the civilian population from their rule. But tensions eventually calmed and martial law was lifted in 1998. Kiszczak helped ease the transition to a civilian government, being appointed prime minister by President Jaruzelski the same year. Yet the two generals have been ineffective in solving the issues plaguing the country. Their rule has seen the economy steadily decline and the opposition movements of the 90s have recently begun to rear their heads again. The aging Marshal Jaruzelski relinquished nearly all power in 2005, leaving General Kiszczak to preside over an ineffectual and unpopular government."
POLITICS_NOAM_CHOMSKY_DESC:0 "The first and only President of the American People's Commonwealth, Noam Chomsky originally found his fame in two vastly different fields - linguistics and social activism. Chomsky, a prominent anarcho-syndicalist activist during the tumultuous 60s, became of one of the most vocal supporters of the big-tent socialist American Labor Party. When Ronald Reagan dissolved the United States, leaders and organizers such as Chomsky and Bernie Sanders founded the American People's Commonwealth in Philadelphia. The Party of Labor and reformist organizations fell to Chomsky's Industrial Workers of the World, and he was soon elected provisional president of a new revolutionary nation. After a three-year constitutional convention finally elapsed, the IWW centralized its power, but faced considerable intra-party deadlock. Chomsky found himself at the whim of international activists like Germaine Greer, who wished to transform the nation into the catalyst of worldwide revolutionary socialism, but also the New Guard and their political organ, the Central Committee. The New Guard, filled with young, pragmatic socialists, opposed Chomsky and his idealistic anarchism at every turn, but with Chomsky's influence in state governorships and the executive branch, neither could gain the upper hand. Now, even old allies like Bernie Sanders have abandoned Chomsky's anarchist movement in favor of true democratic socialism, and the dream of a peaceful American North-East with him at the helm is no closer to fruition."
POLITICS_SLOBODAN_MILOSEVIC_DESC:0 "A controversial leader in Yugoslav politics ever since the 1980s, Slobodan Milošević first rose to prominence with the support of Serbian president Ivan Stambolić. He became notorious in 1987 when he, at a session of the Central Committee, went against his former sponsor to demand a harder line on the controversial Autonomous Province of Kosovo. Stambolić was humiliated by the affair and ultimately forced to resign, with the popular Milošević taking his place as president of Serbia. Soon afterwards the governments of Montenegro, Vojvodina and Kosovo were likewise overthrown, their respective leaderships replaced with Milošević loyalists. Tensions heightened as Milošević and his allies now held de-facto veto power in the presidency of Yugoslavia, while the other republics accused him of exploiting Serbian nationalism for his own gain. This crisis came to a head at the 14th Party Congress in 1990, where Milošević struck a controversial deal with prime minister Ante Marković to push through a new constitution, with more power vested in the central government. In turn both Kosovo and Vojvodina gave up their votes in the presidency, to the anger of many in the two provinces. The compromise was ultimately successful in lowering the tensions in the country. Milošević would go on to serve two terms as president of Serbia before being elected president of Yugoslavia in 1997. As leader he has overturned half a century of Titoist foreign policy, normalizing relations with the Soviet Union and forging closer ties with the European Union of Socialist Republics. While he is still a divisive figure, many Yugoslavs hold a lot of respect for the aging Slobodan Milošević, who helped lead the country through one of the most turbulent periods in history."
POLITICS_LIANA_KANELLI_DESC:0 "Liana Kanelli was a young law student at the University of Athens when she was swept up in a massive student revolt at the onset of the 1973 Greek Revolution. As thousands took to the streets to topple the Regime of the Colonels, Kanelli became involved with the country’s burgeoning socialist movement. Principal among these was a group of communists led by Panagiotis Lafazanis, who had risen from a modest math student to a national leader following the ousting of the military junta. These young communists organized into the Workers’ Party ahead of the constitutional assembly elections in 1974, which saw the country’s political sphere shift profoundly to the left. In the ensuing coalition Lafazanis became the youngest prime minister in Greek history, with Kanelli as his press secretary. As the Workers’ Party consolidated power, Kanelli was appointed ambassador to France and eventually chosen as foreign minister in the now socialist-dominated government. She became known as a forthright and incisive negotiator, as she expertly staved off pressure from both the United States and the Soviet Union. When the now President Lafazanis was assassinated in 2003, Kanelli initiated a vicious struggle for power with prime minister Nikos Konstantopoulos, who was eventually expelled from the party as Liana Kanelli assumed the office of president. Now she is faced with many issues brought by her own actions, as divisions in the party have caused the government and economy to fragment while Greece’s hostile neighbors closely study the isolated state, waiting for any opportunity to strike."

Her father was Aung San, often titled 'Father of the Nation' for his role in achieving Burmese independence. Having spent most of her early life outside Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi returned in 1988 to take care of her dying mother, but was inexplicably swept up in the nation’s fledgling democratic movement. That same year, long time military dictator Ne Win resigned at the height of the Four Eights Uprising, a massive popular revolt that broke out across the nation only to be brutally suppressed by another military coup. Aung San Suu Kyi became an icon for her role in the uprising, and she founded the League of Socialist Salvation to continue the fight against the dictatorship. It wasn’t until 1997 when her goal could be realized, as another popular revolt erupted. In what became known as the Lotus Revolution, the military government willingly handed power to Aung San Suu Kyi in exchange for guaranteeing their continued political influence. But this was not the democratic revolution many had hoped. The following elections established the League as the undisputed rulers of Burma, with little place for domestic opposition. Aung San Suu Kyi likewise cemented her power as president, declaring ‘Buddhist Socialism’ to be the country’s national ideology and ensuring the loyalty of both the People’s Assembly and the powerful Council of Monks. Now, over a decade into her rule, mounting opposition among the people and army may yet bring about her eventual fall from grace."
POLITICS_AYKUT_EDIBALI_DESC:0 "Aykut Edibali was one of the principal founders of the National Struggle Movement, an Islamic nationalist group that campaigned against capitalism, communism and Zionism while supporting the military dictatorship of Alparslan Türkeş. This movement split into many factions in the late Seventies and Edibali led his followers into the National Order Party of Necmettin Erbakan. The party would soon become an important political force, as the remnants of the military government turned to the Islamic right for support. But it wasn’t enough to regain their rapidly declining power. Dissatisfaction with the war against Kurdish separatists forced the army to stand down under threats of a popular uprising, acquiescing to the left-wing government’s calls for peace. With the army removed from political power, the Islamists became the largest force on the Turkish right and they would ultimately end socialist rule in 1996. Edibali was appointed minister of internal affairs in Turkey’s first Islamist government, leading the operation to apprihend the terrorist Abdullah Öcalan in 1998, becoming a national hero overnight. He used this new political capital to consolidate power, eventually encouraging the aging Erbakan to resign with the support of the growing nationalist faction in the party. Taking his place as prime minister in 2001, Edibali has led the party to victory in every election since, but now he faces increasing opposition from the growing communist movement, outraged secularists and even radical Islamists disatisfied with his rule."
POLITICS_ESSAM_SHARAF_DESC:0 "Dr. Essam Sharaf is part of a small group of western-educated academics who rose to prominence under President Anwar Sadat in the late Eighties. His removal of senior officers from political positions gave room for the technocrats who soon came to dominate the government of the United Arab Republic. Sharaf was hired as an expert for the Jordanian government on behalf of Egypt, which sought closer ties to their Arab neighbors while distancing itself from the Soviet Union. He returned to Egypt with the collapse of the Arab Union project in 1992, as fellow technocrat Kamal Ganzouri became president of the UAR. He joined the Arab Socialist Union and was appointed minister of transportation, rising to become prime minister by 1999. As an engineer by trade, his foremost concern while in power was infrastructure expansion and modernization. The efficient planning implemented by his administration led to an economic boom in Egypt, securing his position as successor when President Ganzouri retired in 2004. As leader of the UAR, Sharaf’s efforts to expand his projects to Syria were met with resistance from the ruling Assad family who, seeing him as a threat to their power, stifled all development projects located in their country. Subsequent efforts at reconciliation between Cairo and Damascus have been unsuccessful and with the outbreak of an insurgency in 2009 many have begun to doubt the strength of the Arab socialist project."
POLITICS_WINSTON_PETERS_DESC:0 "The firebrand Winston Peters' rise from renegade National Party MP to military-backed dictator of New Zealand has been nothing short of spectacular. First elected in 1978, Peters advocated for social conservatism and harsher measures against communism while staunchly defending of the welfare state. His unorthodox but deeply populist views led to him to become one of the most beloved politicians in the country, much to the unease of his own party. The Perth Agreement that followed the end of the Australian Civil War in 1989 was supported by both the Nationals and Labour, but Peters labeled it a farce that provided an opening for communism in the Pacific, and advocated for further military action to halt its spread. That same year, a three way election between Labour, the Nationals, and a left-wing alliance under Jim Anderton resulted in complete political deadlock. When it became clear no party could reasonably govern, the military intervened - both to stabilize the government and prevent Anderton's communist-sympathizing coalition from taking power. Following the coup, Winston Peters was chosen as New Zealand's next Prime Minister, viewed by the military as one who could give their new regime legitimacy and political power. Although Peters has succeeded in preventing the rise of communism in New Zealand, his brutal, paranoid methods and his fanatic militarism, which has seen him greatly expand the navy and declare himself an Admiral of New Zealand and Commander-in-Chief, has seen his once-staggering popularity turn into open discontent."

With the victory of the Yanks over the last of the Townerite Indigenous guerrillas, the Norton regime in the Lower 48 appointed Palin as de-jure governor over all of Alaska, where she has ruled ever since. In reality, her grip over the Last Frontier is strenuous at best, and most realize that her days in power are numbered. With a myriad of internal factions all struggling to topple her reign and with the resurgence of the Red Man's paramilitaries in the Alaskan wilderness, even Palin has begun to realize her regime is not long for this world.
