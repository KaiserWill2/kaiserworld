 RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "After the German victory in WW1, the world forever changed. Tensions contiuned to rise though which resulted in the Second World War and the death of nearly 40 million. Whole economies and countries were destroyed during this war with many not fully recovering even to this day. The United States turned into a consitutional monarchy, the Russians became a Socialist Tsardom, and the Bonapartes were restored to the French throne. All the meanwhile the German Empire has contiuned its hegemony, the only question is for how much longer?"
 SOV_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is the dominant power of our world. Its influence stretches across all continents, and many nations depend on its protection. But with a looming power struggle within the Politburo and Chairman Yazov's recently erratic policy decisions, the great Union could be facing its downfall far sooner than expected. With enemies in all directions, can the Communist world order be saved?"
 PRC_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The People's Republic of China is in a difficult position. While Communism and its variants rule most of the world, the Maoist leadership is still at odds with the USSR, and increasingly worried that a powerful and militarised Japan could strike at any moment. By opening various sectors of the economy, China has also opened itself up to external influences, and the coming years could easily see the collapse of Mao's People's Republic."
 GER_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "After being divided for nearly four decades, the two German nations reunited in the mid-1980s with much fanfare. Since then, the German Democratic Republic has maintained a strong military and economy, as well as a stable political system. With nominal control over the European Union, many are beginning to suspect that Germany has become more powerful than the Soviet Union itself, influencing its European neighbours for its own gains. Could Germany become the successor to the dying Soviet world order?"
 PCA_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The Union of American People's Republics was established in the catastrophic collapse of the United States. Loyal Communists and supporters of the Soviet leadership fled West to create a new America based on their vision. Unofficially allied with the USSR, the Union is economically the most powerful of the three major American nations, but has experienced internal tensions since the beginning. Cascadian seperatists and a religious heartland have brought much pain for the leadership, and if the Soviet world order collapses there will be few friends for this nation to turn to."
 NEA_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The American People's Commonwealth is a nation of Communists who have no loyalty to the Soviet Union, condemning it as fascist and an abomination. When the United States collapsed, these like-minded activists enforced their iron grip over the North-East, expelling all upper class citizens, or at least those who hadn't already left. But now the economy is stagnating and the Commonwealth's industrial capabilities have collapsed. Can this unusual enemy of the USSR get itself back on its feet before either the Soviets or Southern remnants take it all away?"
 USA_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The Greater Empire of America was birthed from the ashes of the old United States of America following the end of the Second American civil war. The Norton's have become one of the most recognizable royal families in history and have been able to provide stability to the once fractured country, but it has once again become divded after the controversial 2008 election where Bernard 'Bernie' Sanders won in a narrow victory. Some hail him as the savior of the country while others plaster him as a puppet of the Russians. At this point, who knows what will happen?"
 ENG_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom is seen by many as the last bastion of democracy in Europe. In lengthy talks with the Irish government, both sides agreed in the early 1980s to put aside their differences and create a unity government in Northern Ireland, allowing Britain to divert its political power to halting revolution. In the decades since, tensions in the Kingdom are boiling over, with Prime Minister David Owen seen as a threat to the survival of the European Union and the Soviet world order. Will the United Kingdom continue on its path of isolation and stability, or will a strong leader take charge?"
 OTHER_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Storm clouds are brewing. As the final battle between communism and its greatest enemies draws near, every nation has the opportunity to set its path and decide their own future."

 ITA_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The Italian Union is the shining Red Jewel of the Mediterranean, a beacon of socialist prosperity in a time where the red star of Moscow is waning. With the establishment of Communist rule in 1984, when Enrico Berlinguer formed a coalition with the Socialist Party, the country has put the violent Years of Lead behind it. Today, Italy is a peaceful society, and although the problems with the Mafia represents some issues, this peace generally reigns undisturbed. However, storm clouds are gathering on the horizon, and time will tell whether the Socialist Revolution can hold together in the 21st century."

 ENG_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Michael foot was voted into power by the totalist congress. Foot was leader until 1995 where he suffered from a stroke and passed away. Not long after the Hardliner brute who was in second command of the union,  Anthony Charles Lynton Blair became leader. Within the first year of his rule England dramatically changed. Those who were suspected of going against the party were sent to labour camps and those who tried to escape into the republic of Scotland or wales were sentenced to death. Blair increased funding into nuclear weapons and slashed funding into other services increased poverty in England. The world feared Tony was about to tip the scales on world peace. He punished anyone who did not serve in the Totalist army and rewarded those loyal enough to find traitors in the country and hand them in. from the year 2000-2005 Blair increased the isolationist nation preventing outside news leaking in and constantly demanding Scotland and wales to join back into the union like the old days. Small skirmishes have increased within recent years on the English borders with more English trying to seek help in Scotland and Wales. Blair has recently clamped down harder on the people forcing them to take part or watch military parades. France has always accepted those wishing to flee from England causing hostile relationships in the English Channel. Blair has ruled England for just over 15 years now and still rules with a hard iron fist refusing to give up power even if the population starve and cry for help he refuses to help only to focus on military power and build the English army to be one of the most powerful in Europe forcing his people to join. Meanwhile younger members of the totalists such as the reformers are increasing their push to power and remove blair where as the Scottish nation is preparing for a  whole scale invasion of the English state and free the people."
