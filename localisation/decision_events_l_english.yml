 decision_event.1.t:0 "The Dumfries War"
 decision_event.1.d:0 "Prior to the start of the war, the USBR military under the leadership of Chairman Lawrence went through a drastic purge often referred to as “The Great Purge”. This saw generals like Bill Alexander be imprisoned and eventually executed. From here several low-ranking officers were promoted to general. To give these generals experience in combat, Lawrence started to give speeches about unifying the nation under the banner of totalism, and his first target was to be Scotland.\n\nOn July 5th, 1950, USBR soldiers started to amass on the border in Northumbria while several airborne divisions boarded planes. At 12:30 am EST/ 6:30 pm CEST, 6 divisions of airborne infantry landed in Dumfries, Scotland while 12 divisions of mechanized infantry crossed to border. By 12:00 am CEST, Edinburgh came under the control of syndicalist forces. This prompted the government to retreat to Inverness. To combat the spreading of Syndicalism, the UN called on nations to intervene in this conflict. Both Canada and the German Empire were the first to send divisions. For days the Scottish military was beaten back, eventually being relegated to the Hebrides. That did change on August 1st when General Walter Model landed soldiers in Dunbar. From Dunbar, General Model would lead his soldiers towards retaking Edinburgh. They’d surround the city laying siege to it. With American and Canadian reinforcements, the syndicalist forces would be pushed back.\n\nWith the capture of Edinburgh came Russia’s involvement in the war. While no generals were sent, several divisions were placed under the direct control of Chairman Lawrence. These divisions named the “Peoples Volunteers”, would fight in several of the most significant battles more than half would perish in the battle of Oxford.\n\nWhile conflict would continue for another year, an armistice would be signed on October 19th, 1951 members from the Scottish government and members of Lawrence’s cabinet met aboard the German Supercarrier “SMS Siegfried” where the Syndicalists accepted terms of peace. To this day, every chairman has vowed to avenge the wrongs of the war."

 decision_event.3.d:0 "In the old days of the union Michael Foot lead the state until 1995 where he suffered from a stroke and passed away. Not long after the Hardliner brute who was in second command of the union, Anthony Charles Lynton Blair became leader. Within the first year of his rule England dramatically changed. From the year 2000-2005 Blair increased the isolationist nation preventing outside news leaking in. Blair also ensures total loyalty to him imprisoning anyone who speaks out against his rule. England is ruled with an iron fist and is ready for any war to break out with the population under strict law its unlikely anything is to change soon in the union.."

 decision_event.4.d:0 "The Peoples Palace is the home of the current leader in the U.S.B.R. What used to be Buckingham Palace lay deserted and empty until the 1950s when T.E Lawrence ordered the Palace to be refurbished to fit the image of the union. Once complete, the war hero moved his home into the Palace and kept watchful eyes over the city of London. Now with Tony Blair in control, parts of the palace are being rebuilt to hold solid gold statues of the leader and small missile silos ready to fire at targets who may try to attack his home.  "
