 decision_event.1.d:0 "Prior to the start of the war, the USBR military under the leadership of Chairman Lawrence went through a drastic purge often referred to as “The Great Purge”. This saw generals like Bill Alexander be imprisoned and eventually executed. From here several low-ranking officers were promoted to general. To give these generals experience in combat, Lawrence started to give speeches about unifying the nation under the banner of totalism, and his first target was to be Scotland.\n\nOn July 5th, 1950, USBR soldiers started to amass on the border in Northumbria while several airborne divisions boarded planes. At 12:30 am EST/ 6:30 pm CEST, 6 divisions of airborne infantry landed in Dumfries, Scotland while 12 divisions of mechanized infantry crossed to border. By 12:00 am CEST, Edinburgh came under the control of syndicalist forces. This prompted the government to retreat to Inverness. To combat the spreading of Syndicalism, the UN called on nations to intervene in this conflict. Both Canada and the German Empire were the first to send divisions. For days the Scottish military was beaten back, eventually being relegated to the Hebrides. That did change on August 1st when General Walter Model landed soldiers in Dunbar. From Dunbar, General Model would lead his soldiers towards retaking Edinburgh. They’d surround the city laying siege to it. With American and Canadian reinforcements, the syndicalist forces would be pushed back.\n\nWith the capture of Edinburgh came Russia’s involvement in the war. While no generals were sent, several divisions were placed under the direct control of Chairman Lawrence. These divisions named the “Peoples Volunteers”, would fight in several of the most significant battles more than half would perish in the battle of Oxford.\n\nWhile conflict would continue for another year, an armistice would be signed on October 19th, 1951 members from the Scottish government and members of Lawrence’s cabinet met aboard the German Supercarrier “SMS Siegfried” where the Syndicalists accepted terms of peace. To this day, every chairman has vowed to avenge the wrongs of the war."
