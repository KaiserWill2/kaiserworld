 decision_event.1.t:0 "The Dumfries War"
 decision_event.1.d:0 "Prior to the start of the war, the USBR military under the leadership of Chairman Lawrence went through a drastic purge often referred to as “The Great Purge”. This saw generals like Bill Alexander be imprisoned and eventually executed. From here several low-ranking officers were promoted to general. To give these generals experience in combat, Lawrence started to give speeches about unifying the nation under the banner of totalism, and his first target was to be Scotland.\n\nOn July 5th, 1950, USBR soldiers started to amass on the border in Northumbria while several airborne divisions boarded planes. At 12:30 am EST/ 6:30 pm CEST, 6 divisions of airborne infantry landed in Dumfries, Scotland while 12 divisions of mechanized infantry crossed to border. By 12:00 am CEST, Edinburgh came under the control of syndicalist forces. This prompted the government to retreat to Inverness. To combat the spreading of Syndicalism, the UN called on nations to intervene in this conflict. Both Canada and the German Empire were the first to send divisions. For days the Scottish military was beaten back, eventually being relegated to the Hebrides. That did change on August 1st when General Walter Model landed soldiers in Dunbar. From Dunbar, General Model would lead his soldiers towards retaking Edinburgh. They’d surround the city laying siege to it. With American and Canadian reinforcements, the syndicalist forces would be pushed back.\n\nWith the capture of Edinburgh came Russia’s involvement in the war. While no generals were sent, several divisions were placed under the direct control of Chairman Lawrence. These divisions named the “Peoples Volunteers”, would fight in several of the most significant battles more than half would perish in the battle of Oxford.\n\nWhile conflict would continue for another year, an armistice would be signed on October 19th, 1951 members from the Scottish government and members of Lawrence’s cabinet met aboard the German Supercarrier “SMS Siegfried” where the Syndicalists accepted terms of peace. To this day, every chairman has vowed to avenge the wrongs of the war."

 decision_event.3.d:0 "In the old days of the union Michael Foot lead the state until 1995 where he suffered from a stroke and passed away. Not long after the Hardliner brute who was in second command of the union, Anthony Charles Lynton Blair became leader. Within the first year of his rule England dramatically changed. From the year 2000-2005 Blair increased the isolationist nation preventing outside news leaking in. Blair also ensures total loyalty to him imprisoning anyone who speaks out against his rule. England is ruled with an iron fist and is ready for any war to break out with the population under strict law its unlikely anything is to change soon in the union.."

 decision_event.4.d:0 "The Peoples Palace is the home of the current leader in the U.S.B.R. What used to be Buckingham Palace lay deserted and empty until the 1950s when T.E Lawrence ordered the Palace to be refurbished to fit the image of the union. Once complete, the war hero moved his home into the Palace and kept watchful eyes over the city of London. Now with Tony Blair in control, parts of the palace are being rebuilt to hold solid gold statues of the leader and small missile silos ready to fire at targets who may try to attack his home.  "

 decision_event.6.t:0 "The Weltkrieg over Wallonia"
 decision_event.6.d:0 "Started in the Summer of 1938, the Second Weltkreig would start with an invasion of the Belgian lowlands. While initially supported by Chairman Oswald Mosely of the USBR, the French would ultimately be left alone in this war as the Union collapsed. With an ingenious tactic of rapid tank warfare the French were able take key points in the Rhineland.\n\nOn the Eastern Front, the Russian government in St. Petersburg was being steadily pushed back to the capitol by Mladrossi’s Monarcho-Bolshevist forces. Due to their ideological similarities with Western Bolsheviks, the Russians were facing a two front war one which had already racked up over 700,000 casualties.\n\nLooking to September of 1939, the Germans would face a horrible at the Second Battle of Frankfurt. What started out as a probable win turned sour when the French forces retook city hall. During this charge, the German war Hero August Von Mackensen would take a bullet to the chest and die moments later. This death shattered the morale of the Friekorps and brought the Germans into a retreat. During this time, seeing an advantage the National French Forces under the command of the Napoleonic heir would declare war on the Commune.\n\nIn November of 1939, Russians would come to face a new enemy in the Almighty Don Host. Starting out as small raids, Pyotr Krasnov’s forces would capture several small points on the Dnieper River ultimately forcing the Parliamentarian Russians into a peace treaty which grated the Host territories on both the Dnieper and Volga rivers.\n\nBy December of 1939, the Germans had gained their first victory over Syndicalism as their Scottish allies had won their independence and Mosley was deposed.\n\nStarting on New Year’s of 1940 the largest naval invasion in history would be conducted by Entente forces from Algeria. A combined Canadian-French-Australasian-Indian naval force would bombard the beaches of southern France while coalition forces landed forces at each major city. While the battle lasted several days, coalition forces would secure a beachhead in the south of France.\n\nIn the east, the St. Petersburg government signed “The Treaty of Helsinki” which surrendered itself to the Mladrossi government. Dmitry Romanov would once again go into exile, finding a home in Berlin.\n\nDuring this time, the Japanese and Mongolian governments would start a joint war for dominance in mainland China. While nothing was done about it, the Canadian, Russian, and Pacific American government would condemn this action.\n\nThe next major action of the war would occur in 1942 when the new Russian government declared war on both the Almighty Don Host and the Reichspact. In a repeat of history, the Russian forces decimated Reichspact forces and within two months, Russian forces completely occupied both the Ukraine and Belarus. In the Second Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Germans were forced to abandon any claims past the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and pay the Russian government indemnities."

 decision_event.7.t:0 "The Weltkrieg over Wallonia"
 decision_event.7.d:0 "The war would finally turn in 1943, when under the command of Eric Von Manstein, German forces were able to retake the city of Frankfurt and push the French advance back. Manstein would be granted full command of the German forces on the Western front. While still suffering many setbacks such as the Battle of Koblenz or the Push for Strasbourg, Manstein would ultimately retake the Rhineland and force the French out of the Benelux by 1944.\n\nIn the south of France, Entente forces would slowly push towards Bordeaux before marching North.\n\nBy the Spring of 1945 German soldiers had finally pushed into French territory scoring major victories at Dunkirk, Calais, Marne, and Verdun while Entente soldiers pushed for Paris. During this time, a test of the first atomic bomb was conducted in Duetsch Indochina.\n\nAlong with this, Russian forces still high off their victory over the Germans turned their attention towards the Japanese. Starting the Second Russo-Japanese War, Field Marshal Gregory Zhukov crossed into Japanese Manchuria. Over the course of a month, Japanese garrison forces and the Kwantung army collapsed leaving Korea and the rest of Mainland China open.\n\nCome the July 8th, 1946 the city of Paris would fall to General Bernard Montgomery and for the first time in nearly a century, forces loyal to a Bonaparte would enter the city. Commune leadership would flee to Orleans and vow to continue “The Proletariats War”. With a victory over Paris, Emperor Norton II of America declared his intention to involve the country in the war citing the damage syndicalism had done to American soil.\n\nThe war in France would come to an end on August 9th 1946 when the Germans dropped “Wilhem I” on the city of Orleans. The nuclear explosion would not only kill French leadership but destroy the French peoples will to fight. Immediately from there, General Maurice Gamelin sent out a general order for any military group to lay down their arms.\n\nIn the Asian theater, a combined force of Russian and Chinese soldiers were able push back the forces of Japan to Taiwan and the home islands. Japan was forced to sign the treaty of Vladivostok which rid them of most colonies and forced the country into an economic recession.\n\nThe War in Europe would officially end with the Second Treaty of Frankfurt. It would grant the German empire Alsace-Lorraine while the French Monarchy was granted the rest of the nation.\n\nSo ends the Second Weltkrieg"
