 decision_event.1.d:0 "Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts was assassinated on Wednesday, March 16, 1955, at 11:42 am in Albany, New York just minutes after meeting Governor William Harriman. Kennedy was in secret talks with the Governor of New York concerning possible cabinet membership in the event of the former's victory in an upcoming presidential election. Walking out of the State Capitol in the arms of wife Jacqueline, young Senator Kennedy was fatally shot by lone gunman David Ferrie. The presidential hopeful was pronounced dead at Albany Medical Center approximately twenty-five minutes after the terrifying shooting. While conspiracies have circulated wildly since that day, the generally accepted consensus is that Kennedy's numerous calls for peace in Cuba no matter the cost agitated Ferrie's strong anti-Communist sentiments. It is also believed that the pilot assumed Kennedy was preparing for a Presidential bid in 1956, and assassinating him early was the only way to stop a 'Marxist-sympathiser' from occupying the White House. His death is seen by some as a turning point in American political history, unbeknownst to those at the time, as Kennedy's immense popularity indicated that in a presidential race he would win a landslide. Hence the political troubles plaguing upcoming elections could have been avoided."

Eisenhower won a landslide victory over Democrat Adlai Stevenson, ending a string of Democratic Party wins that stretched back to 1932. Incumbent Democratic President Harry S. Truman had initially sought a second full term, but the unpopular incumbent withdrew from the race following North Korea's devastating victory in the Korean War. After Truman's withdrawal, the president and other party leaders rallied around Stevenson, the moderate Governor of Illinois. Stevenson emerged victorious on the third presidential ballot of the 1952 Democratic National Convention, defeating Kefauver, Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia, and other candidates. The Republican nomination was primarily contested by conservative Governor Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Eisenhower, a general who was widely popular for his leadership in World War II. With the support of Thomas E. Dewey and other party leaders, Eisenhower narrowly prevailed over Taft at the 1952 Republican National Convention. The Republicans chose Richard Nixon, a young anti-Communist Senator from California, as Eisenhower's running mate. Eisenhower retained his enormous popularity from the war, as seen in his campaign slogan, "I Like Ike." Eisenhower's popularity and Truman's unpopularity led to a Republican victory, and Eisenhower won 55% of the popular vote. He carried every state outside of the South and won several Southern states that had almost always voted for Democrats since the end of Reconstruction. Republicans also won control of both houses of Congress."

 decision_event.3.d:0 "The Korean Peace Agreement, known commonly around the world as the 'surrender at Okpo-dong' was the unconditional surrender of American forces on the Korean peninsula on July 5, 1952. In the weeks proceeding, a small remaining number of troops was isolated within the South-Eastern tip of Korea, notably after the fall of Busan to Communist forces. On Geoje Island, General Mark Clark desperately awaited evacuation, but as time passed realised that the government had abandoned all hope of bringing them back safely. On the fourth of July Clark's troops surrendered to encircling KPA units, and the following day signed an agreement that formally terminated all American military presence in Korea, although it was already technically illegal internationally. The surrender at Okpo-dong was not just a victory in conflict for North Korea, but also a major propaganda success, with the image of shattered US soldiers being spread far and wide across the world. For the first time in recent memory, America had lost."

 decision_event.4.d:0 "The 1953 Iranian coup d'etat was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom and the United States. Mossadegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a British corporation, and to limit the company's control over Iranian petroleum reserves. Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country. After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically. Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government. Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the predecessor Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that CIA involvement would set. Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, to rule more firmly as monarch."

 decision_event.5.d:0 "The 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat was a covert operation carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency that deposed the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz and ended the Guatemalan Revolution. Code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, it installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas, the first in a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in Guatemala. Eisenhower was elected U.S. President in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism. Additionally, the U.S. government drew exaggerated conclusions about the extent of communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Arbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare. This included a radio station that broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Arbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador. Described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, and contributed to long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America."

The divisive incumbent President, Republican Dwight Eisenhower successfully ran for re-election. Eisenhower, who had first become famous for his military leadership in World War II, had become far more divisive than expected due to his tough stance on Communism appearing to fail. Nevertheless, he was unopposed at the Republican National Convention and faced a broad national following similar to but not quite to the extent of his first election campaign. Governor William Harriman defeated 1952 nominee Adlai Stevenson and other candidates to seize the Democratic Party's nomination, calling for a 'New Wave' against well-established social policies. In the end, Harriman's attempt at creating a populist movement while clearly being a member of the elite establishment doomed the Democratic Party in 1956, handing a second term to President Eisenhower on election night. The incumbent lost support with Republicans but surprisingly made significant gains among Democrats, especially white urban Southerners and Northern Catholics. This would be the last presidential election where a candidate won outright until 1972."

 decision_event.7.d:0 "The civil rights movement was a decades-long movement with the goal of securing legal rights for African Americans that other Americans already held. Encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized social movements to accomplish the goals of ending legalized racial segregation and discrimination in the United States, the movement, using major nonviolent campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection of all Americans. Moderates in the movement worked with Congress to achieve the passage of several significant pieces of federal legislation overturning discriminatory practices. President Rhodes' Civil Rights Act of 1966 expressly banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment practices; ended unequal application of voter registration requirements; and prohibited racial segregation in schools, at the workplace, and in public accommodations. Successive legislation rapidly ended legal inequality in the United States, most notably during the Rhodes Presidency and his successor Lyndon Johnson's first year. From 1962 through 1971, a wave of inner-city riots in black communities undercut support from the white middle class but increased support from private foundations. The emergence of the Black Power movement, which lasted from about 1963 to 1982, challenged the established black leadership for its cooperative attitude and its practice of nonviolence, and instead demanding that, in addition to the new laws gained through the nonviolent movement, political and economic self-sufficiency be built in the black community. The charismatic universally recognised leader of the civil rights movement Martin Luther King played a significant role in inspiring millions around the nation, and his assassination attempt is seen as the final blow against pro-segregation movements."

In a closely contested election, Republican Vice President Richard Nixon defeated Democrat George Smathers. This was the first election in which all fifty states participated, the first in which an incumbent president was ineligible to run for another term, and the first since 1876 where the winner was decided by the House. Nixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower. Smathers, a Florida senator on the other hand battled against a range of adversaries. Most notably Lyndon B. Johnson, who after losing the nomination to Smathers, formed his own 'Independent Democrats' party to contest the November election. The issue of the Cold War dominated the election, as tensions were high between the United States and the Soviet Union. Nixon only just seized the highest number of electoral college votes, six higher than Democratic nominee Smathers and far above rebel Johnson's forty-nine. Due to no candidate reaching the 269 threshold, Congress was called upon to elect the 35th President of the United States. Having won in both houses since the early 1950s, the Republican Party controversially approved Vice President Nixon's rise to the highest office in the land. For a brief period of extremely unusual political intricacies, Nixon's running mate Jim Rhodes became President as a caretaker head of state, later rising to the call again after the President's assassination on election night 1964."

In response to a failed counterrevolutionary coup in Havana, sponsored by the United States and Haiti, Soviet leader Malenkov decided to agree to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during telephone calls between Malenkov and Fidel Castro in March 1961 and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that Summer. Secretary of State William Rogers managed to convince the initially cautious Richard Nixon to establish a military blockade in order to prevent missiles from reaching Cuba. Under Secretary of State and the alleged mastermind behind the blockade, Henry Kissinger announced to a White House press conference that the United States would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba. Demands were subsequently made that the remaining missiles be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union. After a long period of tense negotiations, Nixon fired Secretary Rogers for attempting to subvert the President's authority and organise another Haitian-backed coup in Cuba. Following the shocking expulsion, Nixon came to be seen as a Communist sympathiser in the last days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, finally conceding to Malenkov in a spectacular capitulation. On August 15, 1961, the United States agreed to withdraw all nuclear missiles from Turkey and Italy, and the Soviet Union was permitted to maintain half of its arsenal on the island of Cuba. The crisis remains a low point for US supremacy in the Cold War, giving Moscow an edge that would last for at least another decade."

The President, set on a political collision course with Democrat Lyndon Johnson and Independent Nelson Rockefeller that very night, was being heckled by another guest of the hotel when multiple shots were fired at the commander in chief from behind. Lee Harvey Oswald was the gunman who murdered Nixon on 1964's election night, supposedly for the sole purpose of destabilising his home nation in the short term. After Oswald was tackled to the ground by secret service agents, the President was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, but despite the work of Los Angeles' finest doctors died approximately fifty minutes later. Votes cast in Nixon's name at the ballot box were subsequently transferred to Vice President Jim Rhodes, who would go on to be elected President by Congress with the reluctant support of a battered Nelson Rockefeller. Alongside other dates in American history, the assassination of President Nixon is considered one of the most impactful and destabilising, as the widely accepted view is that after his presidency the state of national politics was forever in turmoil seemingly without the opportunity to repair."

In one of the most chaotic and hotly contested elections in American history, Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson defeated the incumbent Republican President Jim Rhodes, American Independent Party nominee George Wallace and the Republican rebel Ronald Reagan. It was the first election since 1860 where four different candidates won electoral votes and the third election in a row where the winner was decided by the House. Johnson started of as the front-runner for the Democratic Party’s nomination, but he was challenged by prominent anti-war Democrat Robert F. Kennedy, brother of the popular Senator John F. Kennedy who had been assassinated a decade earlier. It was only after Robert’s own assassination at the hands of a Palestinian militant that Johnson secured the nomination. President Rhodes was challenged by the conservative governor of California, Ronald Reagan, who refused to concede defeat and ran his own independent campaign. Alabama governor George Wallace ran on the American Independent Party ticket, campaigning in favor of racial segregation and an end to the Vietnam War. The election year was tumultuous; it was marked by the assassination attempt on Martin Luther King Jr. and subsequent riots across the nation, the assassination of Kennedy, and widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses. Johnson ran a campaign in favor of the war, and promised large anti-poverty programs and support for the civil rights movement. No candidate won enough of the vote to declare outright victory, forcing the House to elect Johnson in a very controversial decision, as North Carolina had declared martial law and refused to release their results."

The aim of the invasion was to regain Western control of the Suez Canal and to remove Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just nationalized the canal. Israel began the invasion on October 29th, to which Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to cease fire, which was ignored. In response the two western powers landed troops along the Suez Canal on November 5th. The Egyptian forces were defeated, but they succeeded in blocking the canal to all shipping, making it strategically useless. It later became clear that the three powers had conspired and planned out the invasion beforehand. Heavy political pressure from the United States and the Soviet Union eventually led to a withdrawal, as President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened serious damage to the British financial system by selling the US government's pound sterling bonds. Israel did secure freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran, which Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. Despite this military success the invasion was a decisive diplomatic victory for Nasser, who secured support from the Soviet Union and strengthened his position as President of Egypt while the Western powers were humiliated. The crisis led to the resignation of British prime minister Anthony Eden and is seen as the end of Britain's role as a major world power."

Ashbrook defeated Democratic Governor George Wallace of Alabama. It was the first election since 1956 where a candidate won an outright majority. Incumbent president Lyndon B. Johnson had initially sought the Democratic Party's nomination, but was forced by the party to withdraw from the race before the first primary. Vice President Hubert Humphrey initially led the polls, but was surpassed by George Wallace. With his ‘outsider’ image, Wallace did well in the South, and among alienated and dissatisfied voters. At the beginning of the campaign he dropped his segregationist stance, announcing that he had always been a ‘moderate’ on racial matters. His populist message won him the Democratic nomination and the nickname ‘the Darling of the Democrats’. The Republican primary was primarily fought between the conservative John M. Ashbrook and the liberal Pete McCloskey. Ashbrook’s nomination was assured when he won an upset victory in California, McCloskey’s home state. The state of the economy was the most important issue of the election. While Wallace championed many of Johnson’s anti-poverty programs, Ashbrook saw them as a massive hole in the federal budget. The economic crises during the previous administrations did little to endear these programs to the American public, who turned to Ashbrook’s right-wing, free market policies. Ashbrook won the election in a landslide, carrying nearly every northern state and even challenging Wallace’s hold over the South. Within months of assuming office his policies would start the recovery of the economy and Ashbrook would become one of the most popular presidents in decades, until the Spanish Crisis."

On October 20, 1975 a decorated U.S. Army general revealed highly classified plans to the UN General Assembly. The plans detailed the Ashbrook administration’s intent on invading Spain and reestablishing the dictatorship that had been previously phased out by King Juan Carlos. Francisco Franco had died earlier in the year, leaving the Spanish State in the hands of Juan Carlos. The king then appointed a new prime minister and began democratic reforms, leading to a general election being held in 1975. Socialist parties won a majority of the vote, but were unable to form a stable government. This led Juan Carlos to keep his conservative prime minister under a minority government. But soon afterwards rumors of a communist coup began spreading in Madrid, alongside reports that the socialist government of Portugal was planning an invasion. While Juan Carlos did not think this was enough to stop the transition to democracy, it greatly alarmed President Ashbrook, who devised the plan to restore the Francoist dictatorship and prevent a communist takeover. These revelations were met by immediate backlash from the international community, even from American allies. Ashbrook fired the general, who claimed to have acted in America’s interest, fearing that the invasion would be the nail in the coffin for the U.S. But the damage was done, President Ashbrook’s popularity took the greatest dive in American history just ahead of the 1976 election. The incident had a profound impact across the world, with King Juan Carlos suspending democracy and declaring martial law, while American allies began to turn away from the U.S."

A transcript of the meeting was leaked to the Western press, omitting all classified content and highlighting one remark made by Malenkov. In response to an apparent report that President Lyndon B. Johnson, known for his eccentric personality, had threatened a general with ‘pissing all over him’ if a breakthrough didn’t happen in Vietnam soon, Malenkov joked that he didn’t know if Johnson ‘lived in the White House or in a mental asylum’. This humiliating comment quickly spread from coast to coast, attention divided evenly between Johnson’s alleged comments and Malenkov’s response. The White House denied all allegations and even tried to push back against Moscow for their supposed slander, heightening tensions between the two powers during a particularly volatile period in America.

In the years before the Soviet Union had pursued a policy of Positive Foreign Policy, developing ties with emerging nations in the third world and eventually also nations in Western Europe. This came as a great concern for the White House, which had pursued a tougher anti-communist line since the election of President John M. Ashbrook in 1972. In a surprising move, the Soviet Union also extended this policy of positive relations to the United States. In a speech held to the UN General Assembly, Soviet Ambassador Nikolai Podgorny reached out to his American counterpart and offered to limit the development of strategic weapons, if only the Americans would do the same. To the surprise of many in the international community, Ashbrook accepted. The following months saw many meetings held between the two powers, eventually resulting in the SALT treaty signed by Malenkov and Ashbrook on December 26, 1974. This détente would prove to be short-lived however, as the collapse of the Francoist Regime and the subsequent Spanish Crisis just one year later would exacerbate tensions to an even higher level than before."

In the years prior, much of the Soviet economy was still dedicated to military production, and scientists were directed to essentially find new ways to defend the USSR from a foreign invasion. Malenkov’s NSP drastically reduced the defence budget and instead allocated those funds towards almost every other sector, in particular infrastructure and developments in both urban and rural areas. While extremely controversial at the time, the initiative was seen as one of the greatest moments of Malenkov’s career in the top job, as it ensured that the Soviets wouldn’t waste their revenue on gargantuan military spending, as the United States did for much of the Cold War to combat falsified Soviet military figures."

 decision_event.18.d:0 "In the late 1950s, the United States and the Soviet Union appeared keen to outdo each other in many fields, but most notably in the field of space exploration. American politicians had already expressed some support for an expedition to the Moon, and of course other planets in the Solar System. Their Soviet counterparts also expressed the same desire to their General Secretary, but Malenkov’s response came in the form of a speech to the 1958 Congress that would go down in history as one of the most defining moments of the space race. The General Secretary declared that while the USSR would invest into space developments, it would not be utilising limited funds to simply explore space and outspend the United States. Intead, satellites would be the main focus of the Soviet space program, as they could genuinely help with the economic development of the Union, as well as ensuring the military security and safety of our borders. The speech was a disappointment for many who saw the 1960s as a decade for unprecedented space exploration, in which humanity would reach the Moon and beyond, colonising every rock we could land on. However, historians believe the speech defined how Soviet policy at the time was intelligently dedicated to economic advancement and proving socialism could function and serve its citizens on the ground better than capitalism. Because in contrast, the United States and its allies in Europe spent ridiculous sums on endeavours in space, such as the famous Moon landing of 1971, and yet the propaganda of these missions was minimal once the celebrations had passed weeks later."

Removed from the confines of his allegiance to Lavrentiy Beria, Malenkov’s initial vision for Soviet domestic and foreign policy could be implemented with absolutely no opposition from any organ within the ruling party. Although the late 1960s are seen as the beginning and first brutal years of the Great Freeze, the assassination of Andrei Gromyko in 1971 by an agent of the KGB highlighted the peak of those harsh years, with the General Secretary finally removing the last obstacle to his concept of ‘Positive Foreign Policy’, and triggering the gradual ‘1970s Thaw’, a carefully manipulated plan to encroach upon Europe, after having spread revolution upon revolution in the third world. The Freeze unofficially ended with the expulsion of Leonid Brezhnev’s increasingly large faction of the Communist Party, a clique committed to hardline policy on all fronts, that had grown more and more powerful through Malenkov’s de-liberalisation."

Carter's win was the last democratic victory in a presidential election before the dissolution of the United States. The Spanish Crisis and its political fallout had left President Ashbrook as one of the most unpopular presidents in American history. But his impeachment and subsequent acquittal by the Senate reinvigorated the president and he joined the Republican primaries much to the dismay of his own party. Despite his unpopularity and a multitude of challengers, he managed to narrowly prevail at the national convention. Carter was little-known at the start of the Democratic primaries, but the former governor of Georgia emerged as the front-runner after his victories in the first set of primaries. Campaigning as a political moderate, reformer and Washington outsider, Carter defeated opponents such as Jerry Brown and Mo Udall to clinch the Democratic nomination. Ashbrook trailed by a wide margin in polls taken after Carter's formal nomination, but his popularity rebounded after a strong performance in the presidential debates, and the race was close on election day. Carter won a majority of the popular and electoral vote. He carried the entire West Coast and nearly every state in the South while Ashbrook dominated the Midwest and Northeast. To the surprise of many in the political establishment, Communist Party USA candidate Gus Hall won six percent of the popular vote despite not winning any states.

Many of the presidents’ allies in Congress abandoned him during the crisis while his popularity sunk to its lowest point ever. On 20 March, 1976 Ashbrook became the second president in American history to be impeached when the Republican-dominated House formally adopted the articles of impeachment and forwarded them to the Senate. The trial began in April, presided over by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. Although the case was seen as unwinnable, Ashbrook chose to fight the case. Even as his own party turned against him, he was joined by conservative senators like Barry Goldwater and Jesse Helms. On May 12, Ashbrook was acquitted on both counts as neither received the necessary two-thirds majority vote of the senators present for conviction and removal from office. With the charges dropped the president was able to turn his attention to the 1976 Republican primaries, where his own party was determined to keep him from the nomination."

On the 1st of March 1953, Stalin suffered a cerebral hemorrhage during a stay at his Kuntsevo Dacha. Despite the best efforts of the medical crew on hand, Joseph Stalin passed away on the 5th. By the time of his death, Stalin had led the Soviet Union for 29 years and 43 days, having taken over in the aftermath of Lenin’s death in 1924. His rule was marked by the advent of totalitarianism, with multiple purges of Soviet society taking place on his command and the establishment of an all-pervasive secret police, but also the hard-fought victory in the Great Patriotic War. As the Soviet state geared up for perhaps the most grandiose funeral in its history yet, the Politburo convened to appoint a successor for the departed General Secretary. As Stalin’s appointed heir, Andrei Zhdanov, had passed away five years prior, leadership instead passed to Georgy Malenkov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers who had succeeded Zhdanov. Facing a power struggle with Second Secretary Nikita Khrushchev over the succession, Malenkov allied with the Minister of Internal Affairs Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Soviet Secret Police.

At the same time, it was feared that a single figure would much like Stalin become too powerful. As such, to fill this power vacuum, Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria ended up forming a troika with Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov in an attempt to stave off the reformists in the Politburo, led by Nikita Khrushchev. This alliance was fraught with conflict, as Beria was perhaps the most reviled figure within the Soviet Union, despised for his frequent sexual predation upon the people of Moscow. The alliance held, however, as their combined hold upon the state apparatus was required to resist Khrushchev’s support within the Communist Party itself. The dissolution of the General Secretariat in 1952 meant the title of leadership was now First Secretary, a title Malenkov was barely able to attain, with Nikita Khrushchev holding onto his role as Second Secretary, while also being made First Secretary of the Moscow Party Committee as consolation. With that, a new equilibrium was reached. Malenkov and Beria earned the loyalty of the people with tacit liberalisation, like mass prisoner releases and a slight loosening of censorship in the media, while Molotov secured the support of the Soviet allies in the recently founded Warsaw Pact. Khrushchev’s reformist opposition remained, however, challenging the agenda of the governing troika at multiple avenues in the coming years."

 decision_event.24.d:0 "The 1959 Soviet Coup Attempt was an unsuccessful attempt at removing Premier Georgy Malenkov from office. The coup was led by Nikita Krushchev and his allies in the Communist Party, who became branded as the ‘Anti-Party Group’. This group believed that liberalization was proceeding too slowly and that Malenkov’s reorientation of the economy away from the military was a threat to the Soviet Union. But most of all they opposed the influence of KGB Chairman Lavrentiy Beria, who was seen as the puppetmaster behind Malenkov. These reformers had clashed with the Soviet leadership ever since the death of Joseph Stalin. Khrushchev held a powerful position in the secretariat and his words carried a lot of power in the party. For Beria it became clear that something had to be done to stave him off, therefore the KGB began a campaign of scrutinization against both Khrushchev and his allies, aiming to ruin their reputations so they could be expelled from the party. Despite the paramount secrecy of the operation, word did eventually reach Khrushchev of the plot. In response he called up all his supporters in the Presidium; reformers like Anastas Mikoyan as well as disconcerted members like Nikolai Bulganin. The group urged Malenkov to resign during a meeting in the Presidium, and moved to position Khrushchev as the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers. It was quickly put to a vote, and one that came down to a narrow result: The proposal was voted down 6 to 5, with Minister of Defense Kliment Voroshilov delivering the final vote in Malenkov’s favour. In the aftermath, the ‘Anti-Party Group’ were expelled from the Presidium to a variety of positions on the fringes of the Soviet Union while Khrushchev was tried and executed for treason. In the end Malenkov and Beria had strengthened their positions as leaders and could now look to governing without any opposition."

The purpose of the summit was to strengthen the cause of Socialism in East Asia, and discuss means for which these socialist states could collaborate for this purpose. A grand show was put on by the Chinese hosts, with a grand military parade and a boisterous propaganda campaign to signify to their socialist partners that China was no more a nation of anarchy and warlords, but rather a strong and powerful partner of the Socialist bloc, with Chairman Mao Zedong inaugurating the summit. Talks between the representatives proceeded smoothly, although Mao proved quite tenacious in wanting to make this a project in which China had equal standing with the Soviet Union, despite the leading role typically undertaken by the Soviets. In the end, a series of trade deals were struck, with the Soviets providing their Asian allies with modern industrial machinery and technical experience in exchange for preferential prices on food imports, as well as promises of mutual military assistance programs in case of conflicts with the West. Of note for Western Kremlinologists was the secondary role held by foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov during the Summit, with Georgy Malenkov leading the Soviet delegation and personally being responsible for most of the negotiations. As the Summit drew to a close, the Socialist powers of Asia stood stronger but more importantly, stood together."

 decision_event.26.d:0 "The Iranian Revolution was a series of events that culminated in the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was supported by the United States, and the replacement of his government with a non-aligned, democratic republic. The revolution was supported by various Islamist and leftist organizations and student movements. Demonstrations against the Shah commenced in October 1977, developing into a campaign of civil resistance that included both secular and religious elements. The protests rapidly intensified in 1978 as a result of the burning of Rex Cinema which was seen as the main cause of the Revolution, and between August and December that year, strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country. The Shah left Iran in exile on 16 January 1979, as the last Persian monarch, leaving his duties to a regency council and Shapour Bakhtiar, who was an opposition-based prime minister. Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was invited back to Iran by the government, and returned to Tehran to a greeting by several million Iranians. The royal reign collapsed shortly after, on 11 February, when guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting, bringing Khomeini to official power. Bakhtiar’s government collapsed and he was replaced by Mehdi Bazargan on the orders of Ayatollah Khomeini. Soon after liberals and leftists began organizing a massive campaign of resistance against Islamic rule and on 1 April, 1979 Iran voted by national referendum to reject Ayatollah Khomeini’s proposed theocratic-republican constitution. In the aftermath of the vote, supporters of the more liberal Bazargan carried out a coup, taking control of the government and forcing the Ayatollah to relinquish power. With the prime minister now as the undisputed leader of the government and the revolution, Iran had successfully transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a liberal democracy."

Republican nominee Ronald Reagan defeated incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter, Libertarian nominee Ed Clark and Communist Party USA General Secretary Gus Hall in a landslide victory. Carter's unpopularity and poor relations with Democratic leaders encouraged an intra-party challenge by Senator Ted Kennedy, who was eventually defeated at the national convention. The Republican primaries were contested between Reagan, who had previously served as the Governor of California, former Congressman George H. W. Bush of Texas, and several other candidates. All of Reagan's opponents had dropped out by the end of the primaries, and the national convention nominated a ticket consisting of Reagan and Bush. Reagan campaigned for increased defense spending, implementation of supply-side economic policies, and a balanced budget. His campaign was aided by Democratic dissatisfaction with Carter and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation. Both Carter and Hall attacked Reagan as a dangerous right-wing extremist who would cut Medicare and Social Security. Hall went further, arguing that only a transition to socialism would end the country’s economic malaise. Clark on the other hand supported many of Reagan’s economic policies, but strongly opposed his proposals for a military buildup, positioning himself as the ‘peace candidate’. Reagan won the election by a landslide, taking a large majority of the electoral vote and nearly half of the popular vote. Carter came second but carried just eight states. The Libertarians won three states in the south as well as Maine, while the Communists won Hawaii, Oregon and several faithless electors from California. Reagan received the highest number of electoral votes ever won by a non-incumbent presidential candidate. Reagan’s victory is often seen as the beginning of the end for the United States, as he would be the last president before the Great Collapse seven years later."

 decision_event.28.d:0 "The 1980 Economic Crisis was a severe economic recession that affected much of the western world. In the United States the crisis began in 1980 and lasted until the collapse of the country in 1987, with many of its effects being felt throughout the next decade. A key event leading to the recession was the 1979 Oil Crisis, mostly caused by the Iranian Revolution. What followed was a disruption of the global oil supply and the sharp rise of oil prices worldwide. This caused the already high American inflation to rise to new double-digit highs. The monetary policy undertaken by the Federal Reserve did little to combat the rising inflation and is in fact seen as a contributing factor to the crisis in America. After President Ronald Reagan assumed office in 1981 he began to tackle the crisis by implementing sweeping tax cuts. But as the crisis deepened in 1982, Reagan’s approval rating also dropped. As a result the Republicans lost their majority in Congress during the 1982 Midterm Elections. Faced with an increasingly uncooperative legislature, where socialist and communist parties had made large gains, Reagan was unable to push through any meaningful legislation to combat the crisis. As a result the economy continued to spiral downward until the United States dissolved in 1987, leaving the crisis to be handled by the newly independent states of America."

 decision_event.29.d:0 "The 1963 Economic Report was a report published to the Central Committee of the CPSU,  detailing the last ten years of Soviet economic development, seven of which had been under Georgy Malenkov’s New Socialist Platform. The report came at a pivotal moment in Soviet history, with Malenkov riding the coattails of his successful diffusion of the Cuban Missile Crisis two years prior, making him able to leverage greater influence in domestic politics. As such, the report would be held up as a significant indicator for Malenkov’s domestic policies, causing great excitement in the Soviet government. The report ended up validating Malenkov’s supporters greatly, indicating that the Soviet economy had responded well to the change of attention in favour of civilian industries, as well as the cuts to the bloated Military-Industrial Complex. Of note was the RSFSR, where republic leader Alexei Kosygin had achieved particularly great results under the New Socialist Platform. As such, the 1963 Economic Report proved not just a victory for Georgy Malenkov, but also for the technocratic faction within the State Planning Committee, who would see further successes down the line. In the aftermath of the report, further economic reforms would be undertaken, as Malenkov increasingly promoted the technocratic wing, pushing the more orthodox Marxist-Leninist planners further and further out of influence.

 decision_event.30.d:0 "By 1964, Georgy Malenkov’s mettle had been proven in both domestic and foreign politics, with the Soviet Union seeing progress under his rule. Emboldened by the success of the New Socialist Platform, Malenkov felt that he could now act independently of Lavrentiy Beria, and moved to reshuffle the recently rechristened Politburo. The Politburo was still largely consisting of aging politicians from the Stalin Era, as well as a few new ones added in the aftermath of the aborted 1959 coup, and as such Beria still had allies within the organ. Many older politicians, save the inner circle of Malenkov, Beria and Vyacheslav Molotov, were ‘encouraged’ to retire and replaced with younger faces, including the shining star of the 1963 Economic Report, Alexei Kosygin, who took up charge as the Minister of Finance and was entrusted with a wide berth to carry out his reforms. This heavily strengthened the position of Malenkov in the Politburo, as many of the younger additions had few ties to the old government of Joseph Stalin. As such, Lavrentiy Beria was increasingly marginalized within the Politburo, and although Malenkov made no direct moves against the Chairman of the KGB himself, his position now appeared much more precarious with the removal of multiple supporters from the Politburo. Much like with Nikita Khrushchev five years prior, Beria feared that if he did not act soon, he would lose any chance of power. A new power struggle was brewing in the Communist Party, as relations between Malenkov and Beria cooled drastically in the months following the reshuffle."

Repression throughout the Union had silently risen over the last few years, as the liberalisation enacted during the first few years of Malenkov’s rule had silently receded, all on Beria’s encouragement. Resentment towards the Soviet state apparatus simmered, and eventually, something was going to give. On the 14th of September, unusual movements by the KGB were noticed, and the day later, Beria struck, occupying key infrastructure across Moscow, including the recently completed Ostankino Television Tower, as well as the Kremlin complex. In a speech to the people of Moscow, Beria claimed to have acted to stop ‘the return of the Great Terror’ by a ‘tyrant in the waiting’, calling upon the people of the city to support the KGB forces. They did not succeed in detaining Malenkov, however, who had been tipped off just minutes before Beria’s coup by a KGB whistleblower. Malenkov was hurried off to suburban Moscow, from where he seized control of a local radio station, and shortly after Beria’s speech gave his response. Malenkov squarely put the blame on Beria for every act of repression, every act of cruelty from the Soviet government, in a surprisingly emotional speech from the First Secretary, as calling for the people to rise up against this ‘Red Napoleon’. The people of Moscow quickly picked their side, forming up alongside loyalist elements and drove the unmotivated KGB forces from the city. Beria was captured trying to flee the city, and was sentenced to death for high treason shortly after. In the aftermath, tight controls were put upon the KGB by the Soviet government, to ensure that no such coups may happen again. With that, Malenkov now ruled the Soviet Union alone, as paramount leader, with nobody able to challenge his power. "

At 05:23 in the morning, the city centre was struck by the earthquake, which killed somewhere between 15 and 5500 people. As Tashkent still consisted mostly of densely built, traditional adobe residences, 80% of the city, including more than half of the old city, was demolished by the quake, rendering hundreds of thousands of citizens homeless. The Soviet government knew it had to act quickly, but also saw an opportunity to rebuild the city as a model of Soviet modernity. Construction workers from all across the Soviet Union arrived in the city, to clear the rubble and rehouse the hundreds of thousands in temporary lodgings, while planners in Moscow began to draw up their plans for the new Tashkent. The new city would be defined by wide boulevards and large-scale, earthquake-resistant high rises, as a showcase to the people of what the Soviet Union would bring. However, reconstruction also saw many old landmarks such as the 600-year old mosques of the city swept aside in favour of modern parks and facilities, causing some to opine that the city has lost most of its history. Nevertheless, Tashkent became the model for a new period in Soviet urban planning, emphasizing modernist architecture and for the first time in Soviet history, a greater emphasis on individual rather than collective apartments, on the request of the growing Brezhnevite faction within the Communist Party, a period that would last until the death of Georgy Malenkov in 1988."

Originally, the planned election was fought on a single issue: free trade, but soon evolved into an overall debate on the failed policies of Brian Mulroney following the Great American Collapse. Prime Minister Mulroney had become extremely unpopular after his landslide victory in 1984, especially due to his reliance on the former United States and staunch support for free trade. The New Democratic Party, led by Ed Broadbent, soon overshadowed John Turner's unpopular Liberal Party to become the main opposition to Mulroney, cementing themselves as a pacifist party dedicated to building a self-sufficient Canada free from dependence on NATO and global capitalism. Broadbent's message resonated with Western and Eastern voters both, and his New Democratic Party was able to break PC strangleholds in Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and even Ontario and Quebec, achieving a majority of seats in Canada's House of Commons.\n\nThe election resulted in numerous historical milestones, from the greatest loss of a ruling party for Mulroney's PCs, to the worst performance for the Liberals, who came third for the first time in modern Canadian history. Broadbent, the first social-democratic prime minister to set foot in Ottawa, was hailed as a champion of worker's rights and Canadian democratic sovereignty, and pledged to not expand the Democratic League, NATO's successor, nor engage in any intervention in post-collapse America's conflicts."

It was the sixth election where the winner was decided by the House. Reagan’s re-nomination was opposed by Ben Fernandez and former Secretary of State Alexander Haig. Though he eventually triumphed, the strong primary challenge was seen by many as another hit against the president’s prestige. Former vice president Walter Mondale was initially viewed as the favorite to win the Democratic nomination, but he was challenged by former congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, representing the progressive wing of the party. Chisholm eventually secured the nomination at the national convention, becoming the first African-American woman nominated by a major political party. The aging CPUSA General Secretary Gus Hall chose to not stand in the election, instead endorsing Angela Davis for the presidency. The campaign was tense, Reagan was widely criticized for his failure to tackle the economic crisis, which had been exacerbated by the supply-side economics implemented by his administration. Reagan in turn stoked up fears that both of his opponents were radical socialists who would destroy the country. Reagan won the most electoral votes out of all the candidates on election night, though it was not enough to secure an outright victory.

He was brought to the nearest hospital but succumbed to his wounds before the arrival. Subsequent protests and riots rocked the nation for months and Hall’s funeral garnered thousands of attendants. The communist leader had recently been identified as a possible challenger in the upcoming 1988 presidential election, with polls placing him ahead of prominent Republican and Democratic leaders. The initial police investigation was unable to yield any major results and the case was dropped, though this did little to calm the enraged public and many accused the government of ordering Hall’s assassination. The case was eventually reopened in 1990 by the Commonwealth Police who were able to identify several suspects, including former CPUSA member and FBI informant Morris Childs, but ultimately no one was tried for the murder of Gus Hall and the case remains undetermined."

His condition was quickly stabilized and there was no formal invocation of the presidential line of succession, but a small crisis occurred when secretary of state Alexander Haig declared that he was ‘in charge’. The Armed Forces went down to DEFCON 3 amidst the confusion and fear of a possible invasion due to the unusually large presence of Soviet submarines along the east coast, but the situation was brought under control when Vice President George W. Bush returned from Austin and Haig was forced to publically step down. Reagan recovered quickly and returned to the White House on April 11.

The conflict began in June 1948, when the colonial government in Malaya declared a state of emergency following the murder of three Europeans during an attack on a plantation. Those responsible for the murders retreated into the Malayan jungles where, under the leadership of Chin Peng, they formed the MNLA as the armed wing of the Malayan Communist Party, intending to overthrow the colonial government. The rebels established a series of jungle bases and began conducting raids on British colonial police and military installations. Tin mines and rubber plantations became frequent targets of communist sabotage in attempts to make the colonial occupation of Malaya too expensive to maintain. Though early on the Malayan government was unable to effectively fight back against the rebels, by 1950 the British army instigated the use of the Briggs’ Plan which involved the forced relocation of an estimated 500,000 rural Malayans to guarded camps known as ‘new villages’. These villages were recently constructed and, in most cases, were surrounded by barbed wires, police posts and floodlit areas to keep the inhabitants in and the guerillas out. By 1957, the Federation of Malaya was granted independence from the British Empire and the war of national liberation became untenable for the communists. Three years later the Emergency was declared over, as amnesty had been declared and most communists had left the country. Rebel leader Chin Peng left for Beijing, but would return to reignite the insurgency against the Malayan government in 1967."

It was also the first election in British history to be covered on the BBC, which gave updates to the public about results in constituencies across the nation. The previous years had seen the government of Prime Minister Clement Attlee carrying out wide-ranging social reforms and nationalisations intent on transitioning the United Kingdom to a mixed economy. The Conservative Party, having recovered from their landslide defeat in 1945, accepted most of these nationalisations, including the immensely popular National Health Service. The campaign thus focused on the possible future nationalisation of other industries, which was supported by the Labour Party but opposed by the Conservatives. Another major issue was rationing, which was still in effect over five years after the end of the Second World War. The Conservatives promised to phase out rationing while Labour argued for its continuation. Though Prime Minister Attlee managed to retain a majority in parliament, winning 315 seats, he lost many seats to the Conservatives, who won 298 seats in the House of Commons.

Without the possibility of comfortably passing any meaningful legislation with their slim majority, Labour hoped to appeal to the public by claiming that only they could bring about peace, full employment and a just society. However, by 1951 the party was quickly losing much of its cabinet due to old age, while the Conservatives, still led by Winston Churchill, had elected many new, younger politicians in the last election. The loss of much of Labour’s old guard had also damaged the party internally, leading to the divisions that would harm its electoral performance for the next thirteen years. Despite winning the most votes of any political party in any election in British history, a number not surpassed until David Owen’s landslide victory in 1993, Attlee was unable to gain enough seats to form a government, losing twenty seats and taking Labour down to 295 seats.

The report was brought to Westminster where it was fiercely opposed by the Conservatives and Unionist parties, but Callaghan managed to gather support from the rest of parliament in order to pass the bill. This led to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1984, giving Ireland an advisory role in the government of Northern Ireland and preparing for further negotiations including all parties in the province. The negotiations were at first opposed by Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party, but eventually both sides were encouraged to take their seats at the table. The process was stalled many times, but finally on 25 December 1984 the Christmas Day Agreement was signed in Belfast, establishing a unity government in Stormont and providing for joint Anglo-Irish rule through the council. The agreement largely ended the violence of the Troubles, but Callaghan and the Labour Party faced widespread criticism at home for ceding sovereignty over British land, eventually contributing to their loss in the 1989 general election."
