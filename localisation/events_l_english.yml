 England.1.t:0 "Welcome To The Union"
 England.1.d:0 "In the old days of the union Michael Foot lead the state until 1995 where he suffered from a stroke and passed away. Not long after the Hardliner brute who was in second command of the union, Anthony Charles Lynton Blair became leader. Within the first year of his rule England dramatically changed. From the year 2000-2005 Blair increased the isolationist nation preventing outside news leaking in. Blair also ensures total loyalty to him imprisoning anyone who speaks out against his rule. England is ruled with an iron fist and is ready for any war to break out with the population under strict law its unlikely anything is to change soon in the union.."

 England.4.t:0 "The Legacy OF Michael Foot"
 England.4.d:0 "Michael foot passed away leaving his deputy, Tony Blair to take charge.

 England.4.o1:0 "The Hermit Kingdom"
 England.5.t:0 "Blairs Iron Fist"
 England.5.d:0 "Chairman Blair has sentenced many traitorous generals to death for their crimes against the eternal revolution. With this, many close family members have been placed under watch and some have been confined to their homes as he reforms the nation into something new. Not everyone can be trusted, as even Blair himself has come under the scrutiny of assassination attempts. Praise Blair for his reforms."
 England.5.o1:0 "Blair Strikes At His Own"
 England.6.t:0 "Blairs Weapon Research Order"
 England.6.d:0 "General Blair has ordered many of the USBR’s top scientists to focus more on the development of nuclear weapons than the needs of the people. Blairs logic is that once the USBR has the capability to launch nuclear missiles and liberate the rest of the world from the tyranny of monarchism, then the peoples needs will be met. For now they will have to sacrifice just that that bit for the nation."
 England.6.o1:0 "The Union Moves Forward"
 England.7.t:0 "The Weapon Parade"
 England.7.d:0 "In T.E. Lawrence Square, rockets, tanks, soldiers, and even jets march to show that the hermit state is ready and willing to defend itself.

 England.9.t:0 "The General's TV Broadcast"

 England.9.o1:0 "General Blair Defends His People!"
 England.10.t:0 "The Union Economy Plan"
 England.10.d:0 "The unions economy has always needed support from other far left nations, although the nations have a surplus of oil thanks to the North Sea, many democratic nations refuse to trade with the union causing the economy to slump. Now is the time to finally fix the money problems and expand its friendships with other like-minded leaders."
 England.10.o1:0 "The Peoples Economy Will Be Rebuilt!"
 England.11.t:0 "The Korean Friendship"
 England.11.d:0 "England and Korea do not have the best of relations, but it is our duty to reach out to other totalist allies.

 England.12.t:0 "The Russian Summit"

 England.13.t:0 "The Scottish And Welsh Situation"

 England.14.t:0 "Securing Our Lands"

 England.16.t:0 "The Voice For Unification"
 England.16.d:0 "Scotland and England both wish for reunification but unification for these nations are under very different ideas, Scotland wishes to extend their monarchs power while Blair aims to liberate the proletariat under totalism.

 England.17.o1:0 "Blair Plans His Path"
 England.18.t:0 "The Congress Of England"
 England.18.d:0 "Scotland has recently been hacking into the State Media service and spreading their Pro-Monarchist, Pro- “Freedom” messages to all corners of our nation. They encourage our citizens to leave the nation and flee to Wales or cross the DMZ to Scotland. Our citizens know better than that, and we shall swiftly punish the Scottish for this foolhardy attempt at destabilizing our nation."
 England.18.o1:0 "Blair Plans His Path"
 England.19.t:0 "The Oil Dispute"
 England.19.d:0 "Scotland has ordered warships to meet with our union navy in the North Sea, while our expansion over the oil has been criticised by the Scottish its seems they will not allow us to go quietly. It seems we both are waiting for each of us to fire the first shot. Unfortunately for the Scottish we will never back down from OUR own waters. The oil is ours and will be used to fuel our tanks while we crush the Celtic bastards."
 England.19.o1:0 "Our Water Machines Will Crush The Scots"
 England.20.t:0 "Come On Wales, Dont Be Silly"
 England.20.d:0 "It seems a war with Wales could be pointless, due to our armies massively outnumbering theirs and our armed forces total loyalty.

 England.20.o1:0 "They Have No Choice"
 England.21.t:0 "Cornwall Resistance"
 England.21.d:0 "It seems that our attention to Cornwall has fallen on unwelcome ears. It seems the Cornish wish for an independent state?

 England.25.t:0 "Defending The Union"

 England.26.o1:0 "Thank Our Young Soldiers"
 England.27.t:0 "Remembering Canada"
 England.27.d:0 "Canada is still a black spot in our history.
