 England.1.t:0 "Welcome To The Union"
 England.1.d:0 "In the old days of the union Michael Foot lead the state until 1995 where he suffered from a stroke and passed away. Not long after the Hardliner brute who was in second command of the union, Anthony Charles Lynton Blair became leader. Within the first year of his rule England dramatically changed. From the year 2000-2005 Blair increased the isolationist nation preventing outside news leaking in. Blair also ensures total loyalty to him imprisoning anyone who speaks out against his rule. England is ruled with an iron fist and is ready for any war to break out with the population under strict law its unlikely anything is to change soon in the union.."

 England.4.t:0 "The Legacy OF Michael Foot"
 England.4.d:0 "Michael foot passed away leaving his deputy, Tony Blair to take charge. Blair, a military man, quickly rose through the ranks of the USBR military to Commanding General of the armed forces.

 England.4.o1:0 "The Hermit Kingdom"
 England.5.t:0 "Blairs Iron Fist"
 England.5.d:0 "Chairman Blair has sentenced many traitorous generals to death for their crimes against the eternal revolution. With this, many close family members have been placed under watch and some have been confined to their homes as he reforms the nation into something new. Not everyone can be trusted, as even Blair himself has come under the scrutiny of assassination attempts. Praise Blair for his reforms."
 England.5.o1:0 "Blair Strikes At His Own"
 England.6.t:0 "Blairs Weapon Research Order"
 England.6.d:0 "General Blair has ordered many of the USBR’s top scientists to focus more on the development of nuclear weapons than the needs of the people. Blairs logic is that once the USBR has the capability to launch nuclear missiles and liberate the rest of the world from the tyranny of monarchism, then the peoples needs will be met. For now they will have to sacrifice just that that bit for the nation."
 England.6.o1:0 "The Union Moves Forward"
 England.7.t:0 "The Weapon Parade"
 England.7.d:0 "In T.E. Lawrence Square, rockets, tanks, soldiers, and even jets march to show that the hermit state is ready and willing to defend itself.

 England.8.t:0 "We Love Blair!"
 England.8.d:0 "The people of the USBR must swear their total loyalty to the great leader, those who stand against him are traitors and will be punished.

 England.9.t:0 "The General's TV Broadcast"
 England.9.d:0 "General Blair has appeared on state television announcing the union is finally at a point where it is now able to defend itself against its enemies and is equipped for a modern age.

 England.9.o1:0 "General Blair Defends His People!"
 England.10.t:0 "The Union Economy Plan"
 England.10.d:0 "The unions economy has always needed support from other far left nations, although the nations have a surplus of oil thanks to the North Sea, many democratic nations refuse to trade with the union causing the economy to slump. Now is the time to finally fix the money problems and expand its friendships with other like-minded leaders."
 England.10.o1:0 "The Peoples Economy Will Be Rebuilt!"
 England.11.t:0 "The Korean Friendship"
 England.11.d:0 "England and Korea do not have the best of relations, but it is our duty to reach out to other totalist allies.

The two countries will now begin to trade industrial goods, weapons, food products, and even military intelligence."
 England.11.o1:0 "Juché And Totalism United"
 England.12.t:0 "The Russian Summit"
 England.12.d:0 "Blair has met with the Russian leader and came to a new trade agreement between the nations, with strong investment from Russia and free open trade between the nations to increase products and strength the economies.

 England.13.t:0 "The Scottish And Welsh Situation"
 England.13.d:0 "Under the rule of Oswald Mosley, our great nation collapsed into anarchy and we lost two important areas. Scotland and Wales. Our nation seeks to reunite with our brothers and sisters, whether its through force or whether its through peace is up to the parties involved. Either way"
 England.13.o1:0 "Uniting Our Lands"
 England.14.t:0 "Securing Our Lands"

 England.16.t:0 "The Voice For Unification"
 England.16.d:0 "Scotland and England both wish for reunification but unification for these nations are under very different ideas, Scotland wishes to extend their monarchs power while Blair aims to liberate the proletariat under totalism.

 England.16.o1:0 "Planning Our Final Victory"
 England.17.t:0 "The Congress Of England"
 England.17.d:0 "The annual Congress of the USBR has finally arrived and this year its going to be a big one, many from overseas speculate with the new changes going on in the isle General Blair will outline his plans for army reforms as well as his plans to take Wales and Scotland, rather than focusing on the huge poverty and huge crimes against humanity against his own people."
 England.17.o1:0 "Blair Plans His Path"
 England.18.t:0 "The Congress Of England"
 England.18.d:0 "Scotland has recently been hacking into the State Media service and spreading their Pro-Monarchist, Pro- “Freedom” messages to all corners of our nation. They encourage our citizens to leave the nation and flee to Wales or cross the DMZ to Scotland. Our citizens know better than that, and we shall swiftly punish the Scottish for this foolhardy attempt at destabilizing our nation."
 England.18.o1:0 "Blair Plans His Path"
 England.19.t:0 "The Oil Dispute"
 England.19.d:0 "Scotland has ordered warships to meet with our union navy in the North Sea, while our expansion over the oil has been criticised by the Scottish its seems they will not allow us to go quietly. It seems we both are waiting for each of us to fire the first shot. Unfortunately for the Scottish we will never back down from OUR own waters. The oil is ours and will be used to fuel our tanks while we crush the Celtic bastards."
 England.19.o1:0 "Our Water Machines Will Crush The Scots"
 England.20.t:0 "Come On Wales, Dont Be Silly"
 England.20.d:0 "It seems a war with Wales could be pointless, due to our armies massively outnumbering theirs and our armed forces total loyalty. Rather if we are able to spread our ideology over the state sooner or later they will be joining us and begging for our dear leader to take their state into the USBR."
 England.20.o1:0 "They Have No Choice"
 England.21.t:0 "Cornwall Resistance"
 England.21.d:0 "It seems that our attention to Cornwall has fallen on unwelcome ears. It seems the Cornish wish for an independent state?

 England.22.t:0 "Congress Branches"

 England.23.t:0 "End Of The Congress"
 England.23.d:0 "The laws and reforms have finally finished. The congress has ended the yearly meeting by singing the national anthem “the red flag”. General Blair ended saying this year will be the biggest year of the USBR and change will come to each of our comrades."
 England.23.o1:0 "Time For Celebrations"
 England.24.t:0 "The Union Army"
 England.24.d:0 "General Blair has ordered the complete reconstruction of the Grand Union Army. He has ordered every man and woman to stand with the armed forces and fight for their great and honourable leaders.

 England.24.o1:0 "The Union Will Be Defended!"
 England.25.t:0 "Defending The Union"
 England.25.d:0 "England is surrounded by enemies. Even those who call themselves our allies can not truly be trusted.

 England.26.o1:0 "Thank Our Young Soldiers"
 England.27.t:0 "Remembering Canada"
 England.27.d:0 "Canada is still a black spot in our history. They still claim the mantle of the true English, they bow down to the tyrannical royals and many capitalist enemies of our past still survive in Ottowa. We have engrained in our society the terrors if what happened when Canada failed to reach our shores, and by Blair we’ll make sure it never happens again."

 England.28.t:0 "The New Air Force"

 England.32.t:0 "Drills Of Lindisfarne"
 England.32.d:0 "Lindisfarne is a historical site where the Vikings first landed in Britain and raided the historical monastery of Lindisfarne.

 England.35.t:0 "The Real Union Education"
 England.35.d:0 "The children of Brittania are taught to embrace totalism and it’s values. However, this is not enough. Starting today, from year 1 all the way to year 12, kids will be encouraged to be apart of the Eternal revolution.

 England.41.t:0 "The Talks"

 England.41.o1:0 "This Is Pointless"
 England.42.t:0 "The Talks Fail"
 England.42.d:0 "The Welsh Leaders have asked to sit down with us and try to find a diplomatic way to resolve this matter. It seems they are scared and wish to prevent war and invasion. Unfortunately, they wish for us to stay away from Wales. That isn’t an option.\n\nTHE LEADERS WILL NOT LEAVE US ALONE! THEY BEG AND PLEAD, “THINK OF THE INNOCENT LIVES THAT COULD BE LOST”. We just looked and shook our heads, its obvious they are weak and need to adapt to a new totalist life. Its decided, Wales will be ours and we will train the Welsh people to no longer fear death. "
 England.42.o1:0 "Were Done With This."
 England.43.t:0 "Take The Dragons Head"
 England.43.d:0 "General Blair has given the thumbs up, its war. After nearly 70 years of peace, the union has finally reached a point where it is now ready to shed blood again. The army has begun to walk through the hills of the English border and fired at the border walls on the Welsh side. As guard towers collapsed and the Welsh soldiers tried to fire at us, it seemed that already the war was turning against them. Our soldiers opened fire as union fighter jets roared over the skies of Wales."
 England.43.o1:0 "Its Time To Unite The Union."
 England.44.t:0 "Wales Has Fallen"
 England.44.d:0 "The war as predicated was short and a strong easy win. Once we marched into the city of Cardiff the Welsh Ministry started peace talks and finally agreed a transfer of power. The Welsh State will for now become a temporary transitional state until we have rebuilt the state and we are ready to bring the state of Wales under the totalist banner. Some rebel groups have tried to fight back but their fighting as been put down quick. General Blair has been heard to have celebrated by asking for some Welsh people to be brought to his palace and shot at while he watches and drinks with his generals."
 England.44.o1:0 "We Finally Take The Dragon."
 England.45.t:0 "Down Goes The Flag"
 England.45.d:0 "The red dragon and the Welsh flag will now be icons of an illegal protest and anyone who waves those will be arrested.

 England.46.t:0 "The Trials Of Wales"
 England.46.d:0 "Blair promised no harm would come to the Welsh politicians and would have free passage to leave for Ireland. As they waited at Swansea harbour about to bord a passenger ship, union agents came and quickly arrested them, the leaders shouting their demands as they were told they were allowed to be freed! Once captured they were taken away to London, not long after staged trails had taken place. Each leader admitted their crimes against the USBR and begged for forgiveness. Within minutes the jury had decided their fate, each one was to be founded guilty with either the option of being hung by the neck or shot by firing squad."

 England.47.o1:0 "The End Of Wales"
 England.48.t:0 "The Great Defeat"
 England.48.d:0 "It seems the Welsh were bluffing when they asked us to stop. Once our soldiers crossed into the borders of Wales they were gunned down instantly, the training given to our men and woman had failed as they were completely unprepared. Jets were easily shot out the sky, only weapons from Canada and the US could have done this, it seems the dirty capitalists had been working the whole time with the Welsh and were preparing them for years for this moment. Blair has ordered any man, woman or child who has fled from the battlefield to be shot in the streets and be shown as a moment that the U.S.B.R will never forget!"

 England.49.t:0 "Kill The Runners"

 England.50.d:0 "Fireworks lit up the skies on the Welsh border as they have successfully repealed the war against the U.S.B.R.

 England.50.o1:0 "Damn The Welsh!"
 England.51.t:0 "The Wrath Of General Blair"
 England.51.d:0 "Comrade Blair, the man who promised a return to English glory and supremacy has become the laughing stock of the world. To combat this, General Blair has ordered “Unspecified searches” of homes suspected of dissidents. If they were found to be watching international broadcasts, or reading prohibited books, or even listening to any music that’s not approved by the ministry of culture, then these families were deported off to work camps or shot in the streets."

 England.52.d:0 "General Blair has visited the border of Wales to see exactly what caused the defeat of the army and where it went wrong as well as how they could of overcome the imperialists weaponry being fired upon them. Once he reached the guard tower on the English side he turned to his second in Command, Dermot Hudson who heard a loud bang. Looking at each other Blair fell to the floor holding his chest, blood started to drip through his hand as they began to realise what had happened. A union soldier who escaped onto the Welsh side during the war managed to steal a sniper rifle and fire at Bair, quickly escaping back deep into the Welsh forests. Blair was airlifted to a hospital close by but once there no matter what the doctors did, it was too late, General Blair was dead."

At 0:800 yesterday our great leader General-Chairman Anthony Blair was assassinated by a cowardly Welshman. As the General met with our soldiers on the eve of our invasion, he was shot in the chest from a long-range rifle. His last words were “Do not let the Union fall”. In his last moments, our compassionate leader had only thought about the nation.”\n\nNews of the assassination took days to reach the rest of the world, but across Canada, the American Empire, Scotland, Germany, and even India, celebrations broke out.

Rain fell hard on the streets, to the point that those religious few left in the USBR said “Even God weeps for the fallen General”. His car would proceed to Manchester an hour later, the whole time being followed by a caravan of military and citizen mourners.

The leader was watching as his army either fell or surrendered to the invaders, as he turned around waiting in his office for the three armies to break into his study room, he took a pistol out ready to defend himself and make his last stand.\n\nAs the Scottish army broke down his door, Kennedy took shelter behind his desk, peaking out to shoot at the Scots, the Scottish general ordered for him to surrender but he said nothing and kept shooting, at last the general threw a grenade blowing up. As the general walked over cautiously, he looked over to see the lifeless bloody body of Charles Kennedy laying on the ground."

In a turn of events, without the Kennedy government to formally accede any territory to the UN, the Canadian government has installed a transitional military government.

But nothing has been able to stop the tide of Coalition forces from descending upon the Palace of the Proletariat. Barricades were strung up everywhere and many could not believe that the USBR still fought on. As one Canadian soldier jumped a barricade carrying the old UK flag, he was shot. One bullet may have stopped one man, but it would do nothing against the hundreds of thousands who were working their way in to the Palace from every conceivable corner.\n\nAs the Canadian general broke down the door to Kennedy’s office, he found the dictator sitting in his chair lifeless with a pistol in his hand and blood on his head. “My god, he shot himself, he didn’t even try and fight, he took the cowards way out.” A soldier said as he walked into the room where his general was standing. “Its over now son, the wars finished. Canada can finally rest now its got its revenge, the royal family can return home and lives can stop being taken all because of one greedy many who wanted everything he could. Now he just sits and rots in the chair”. By 7 PM, the Canadian flag was raised over the Palace."

Yet I am not Michael foot, nor am I Anthony Blair. I am simply Boris Johnson. Somehow, someway I rose up through the ranks of the USBR military but I was also a target for Blair who saw my comrades and I as “revisionist scum”. I am not a revisionist, nor am I a syndicalist. As a young child, my father was purged by Foot, and later in life, my mother would suffer the same fate in Cornwall. As an adolescent, I was shipped off to a military school 6 miles away from the Cornwall Work Camps. I grew up hating the ideals preached to me and once Blair died I saw my chance to fix Brittania. Already, my allies and I have instituted several reforms which have freed the people from the tyranny of syndicalism. Yet I am not here to brag, I am here to address three nations.” The crowd stayed dead silent\n\n“To Canada, our doors are open. While we may not yet permit the Royal family back yet, our doors are open for the surviving exiles to see their homes once again. If not for the last time”\n\n“To Scotland, our two nations have had enough problems in the past, some have even escalated to violence. I am up here today to ask for forgiveness so that we may move towards a more positive future.”\n\n“And to the Welsh, from the bottom of my heart, I promise England will do whatever she can to rectify our issues. Anthony Blair is a curse in Welsh, and it shall be in English. Our countries may not unite for a long time or ever but by god, I will put us on the path to rectification and peace.”"
