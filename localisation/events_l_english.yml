 England.1.t:0 "Welcome To The Union"
 England.1.d:0 "In the old days of the union Michael Foot lead the state until 1995 where he suffered from a stroke and passed away. Not long after the Hardliner brute who was in second command of the union, Anthony Charles Lynton Blair became leader. Within the first year of his rule England dramatically changed. From the year 2000-2005 Blair increased the isolationist nation preventing outside news leaking in. Blair also ensures total loyalty to him imprisoning anyone who speaks out against his rule. England is ruled with an iron fist and is ready for any war to break out with the population under strict law its unlikely anything is to change soon in the union.."
 England.1.o1:0 "The Hermit Kingdom"







 England.4.t:0 "The Legacy OF Michael Foot"
 England.4.d:0 "Michael foot passed away leaving his deputy, Tony Blair to take charge. Blair, a military man, quickly rose through the ranks of the USBR military to Commanding General of the armed forces. Said to be Foot’s right hand man, and personal confidant, Tony Blair ascended to the rank of Chairman and now several years after the passing of Foot, Blair has restarted the development of nuclear weapons and with that comes his iron fist."
 England.4.o1:0 "The Hermit Kingdom"
 England.5.t:0 "Blairs Iron Fist"
 England.5.d:0 "Chairman Blair has sentenced many traitorous generals to death for their crimes against the eternal revolution. With this, many close family members have been placed under watch and some have been confined to their homes as he reforms the nation into something new. Not everyone can be trusted, as even Blair himself has come under the scrutiny of assassination attempts. Praise Blair for his reforms."
 England.5.o1:0 "Blair Strikes At His Own"
 England.6.t:0 "Blairs Weapon Research Order"
 England.6.d:0 "General Blair has ordered many of the USBR’s top scientists to focus more on the development of nuclear weapons than the needs of the people. Blairs logic is that once the USBR has the capability to launch nuclear missiles and liberate the rest of the world from the tyranny of monarchism, then the peoples needs will be met. For now they will have to sacrifice just that that bit for the nation."
 England.6.o1:0 "The Union Moves Forward"
 England.7.t:0 "The Weapon Parade"
 England.7.d:0 "In T.E. Lawrence Square, rockets, tanks, soldiers, and even jets march to show that the hermit state is ready and willing to defend itself.

 England.7.o1:0 "The World Watches The Union"
 England.8.t:0 "We Love Blair!"
 England.8.d:0 "The people of the USBR must swear their total loyalty to the great leader, those who stand against him are traitors and will be punished.

 England.8.o1:0 "The Blair Saves The Union!"
 England.9.t:0 "The General's TV Broadcast"
 England.9.d:0 "General Blair has appeared on state television announcing the union is finally at a point where it is now able to defend itself against its enemies and is equipped for a modern age. The new laws and legislations have changed the totalist union ever more and now with a strong iron fist over the nation to increase stability, the people are even more ready to follow their dear comrade leader."
 England.9.o1:0 "General Blair Defends His People!"
 England.10.t:0 "The Union Economy Plan"
 England.10.d:0 "The unions economy has always needed support from other far left nations, although the nations have a surplus of oil thanks to the North Sea, many democratic nations refuse to trade with the union causing the economy to slump. Now is the time to finally fix the money problems and expand its friendships with other like-minded leaders."
 England.10.o1:0 "The Peoples Economy Will Be Rebuilt!"
 England.11.t:0 "The Korean Friendship"
 England.11.d:0 "England and Korea do not have the best of relations, but it is our duty to reach out to other totalist allies. Tony Blair, along with a cadre of close confidants made a trip to the neutral city of Delhi where he met with the Korean leader. The two countries will now begin to trade industrial goods, weapons, food products, and even military intelligence."
 England.11.o1:0 "Juché And Totalism United"
 England.12.t:0 "The Russian Summit"
 England.12.d:0 "Blair has met with the Russian leader and came to a new trade agreement between the nations, with strong investment from Russia and free open trade between the nations to increase products and strength the economies. Not only will this strengthen the relations between the USBR and Russia but also shows the USBR will keep moving forward to defend their union and refuse to allow tensions to settle."
 England.12.o1:0 "Russia And England United"
 England.13.t:0 "The Scottish And Welsh Situation"
 England.13.d:0 "Under the rule of Oswald Mosley, our great nation collapsed into anarchy and we lost two important areas. Scotland and Wales. Our nation seeks to reunite with our brothers and sisters, whether its through force or whether its through peace is up to the parties involved. Either way"
 England.13.o1:0 "Uniting Our Lands"
 England.14.t:0 "Securing Our Lands"
 England.14.d:0 "England and Scotland have the world’s biggest land borders with the highest number of armed forces on a country border. Now with tensions now rising between Scotland, England and Wales Blair has ordered a shoot to kill on anyone who crosses the border."

 England.15.t:0 "Fire At The Wall!!!"
 England.15.d:0 "Blair has given the order to fire at the Scottish border and show the Celtic population England is ready at any moment to take their nation and anyone who leaves the USBR will be met with “fire and fury”."
 England.15.o1:0 "They Will See Our Strong Powerful Mite!"
 England.16.t:0 "The Voice For Unification"
 England.16.d:0 "Scotland and England both wish for reunification but unification for these nations are under very different ideas, Scotland wishes to extend their monarchs power while Blair aims to liberate the proletariat under totalism. Wales apparently has no ambitions whatsoever and just want to be left alone. Wales will the first to fall."
 England.16.o1:0 "Planning Our Final Victory"
 England.17.t:0 "The Congress Of England"
 England.17.d:0 "The annual Congress of the USBR has finally arrived and this year its going to be a big one, many from overseas speculate with the new changes going on in the isle General Blair will outline his plans for army reforms as well as his plans to take Wales and Scotland, rather than focusing on the huge poverty and huge crimes against humanity against his own people."
 England.17.o1:0 "Blair Plans His Path"
 England.18.t:0 "The Congress Of England"
 England.18.d:0 "Scotland has recently been hacking into the State Media service and spreading their Pro-Monarchist, Pro- “Freedom” messages to all corners of our nation. They encourage our citizens to leave the nation and flee to Wales or cross the DMZ to Scotland. Our citizens know better than that, and we shall swiftly punish the Scottish for this foolhardy attempt at destabilizing our nation."
 England.18.o1:0 "Blair Plans His Path"
 England.19.t:0 "The Oil Dispute"
 England.19.d:0 "Scotland has ordered warships to meet with our union navy in the North Sea, while our expansion over the oil has been criticised by the Scottish its seems they will not allow us to go quietly. It seems we both are waiting for each of us to fire the first shot. Unfortunately for the Scottish we will never back down from OUR own waters. The oil is ours and will be used to fuel our tanks while we crush the Celtic bastards."
 England.19.o1:0 "Our Water Machines Will Crush The Scots"
 England.20.t:0 "Come On Wales, Dont Be Silly"
 England.20.d:0 "It seems a war with Wales could be pointless, due to our armies massively outnumbering theirs and our armed forces total loyalty. Rather if we are able to spread our ideology over the state sooner or later they will be joining us and begging for our dear leader to take their state into the USBR."
 England.20.o1:0 "They Have No Choice"
 England.21.t:0 "Cornwall Resistance"
 England.21.d:0 "It seems that our attention to Cornwall has fallen on unwelcome ears. It seems the Cornish wish for an independent state? Well Blair certainly is laughing at this, they will soon see what independence is when they are working in labour camps providing for the union while each of their generation is born and dies in the camps."
 England.21.o1:0 "Freedom Is Slavery"
 England.22.t:0 "Congress Branches"
 England.22.d:0 "The Congress has agreed it is now time to settle small councils into different areas of England and allow local councils to control the populations in different areas of England. The councils will determine budget and local issues but will still take orders from the congress."
 England.22.o1:0 "All Our People Will Finally Have Law And Order"
 England.23.t:0 "End Of The Congress"
 England.23.d:0 "The laws and reforms have finally finished. The congress has ended the yearly meeting by singing the national anthem “the red flag”. General Blair ended saying this year will be the biggest year of the USBR and change will come to each of our comrades."
 England.23.o1:0 "Time For Celebrations"
 England.24.t:0 "The Union Army"
 England.24.d:0 "General Blair has ordered the complete reconstruction of the Grand Union Army. He has ordered every man and woman to stand with the armed forces and fight for their great and honourable leaders. Many families wave goodbye to their children as they leave to train with the best weaponry the Union can offer. Praise Blair and the Eternal Revolution."
 England.24.o1:0 "The Union Will Be Defended!"
 England.25.t:0 "Defending The Union"
 England.25.d:0 "England is surrounded by enemies. Even those who call themselves our allies can not truly be trusted. Our wise leader has ordered every last inch of coastline to fortified with concrete bunkers, guns, and artillery. No longer will you have a day at the beach as our enemies will try to breach our nation.\n\nEngland must be protected against nation even those who work with us. No one can be trusted. Now"

 England.26.t:0 "Serving The Union"
 England.26.d:0 "When a young man or woman reaches the age of 16, they will be whisked away to their nearest training camp where they will become soldiers for Comrade Blairs honour.

 England.26.o1:0 "Thank Our Young Soldiers"
 England.27.t:0 "Remembering Canada"
 England.27.d:0 "Canada is still a black spot in our history. They still claim the mantle of the true English, they bow down to the tyrannical royals and many capitalist enemies of our past still survive in Ottowa. We have engrained in our society the terrors if what happened when Canada failed to reach our shores, and by Blair we’ll make sure it never happens again."
 England.27.o1:0 "We Will Never Let Our Nightmare Come True"
 England.28.t:0 "The New Air Force"
 England.28.d:0 "The U.S.B.R skies are always being intruded by Scotland or French jets. Now with our orders to rebuild our army, the new air force of the Union will be ready to intercept nations who wish to test us and feel our might as we rain down bullets onto their airforce."

 England.31.t:0 "Seas Of England"

 England.31.o1:0 "The Seas Of England Will Be Defended!."
 England.32.t:0 "Drills Of Lindisfarne"
 England.32.d:0 "Lindisfarne is a historical site where the Vikings first landed in Britain and raided the historical monastery of Lindisfarne. It welcomed many visitors in the past but has now been closed and rebuilt as an army training sight. Now General Blair has ordered for the weapons of mass destruction to be used on the Island near Scotland to demonstrate the unions power and might!"
 England.32.o1:0 "Holy Island No More"
 England.33.t:0 "England Stands Ready"
 England.33.d:0 "Leaving Portsmouth harbour the new union fleet demonstrated their new turrets and ships firing across the channel towards France while General Blair was stood in audience watching the fleet leave.

 England.35.t:0 "The Real Union Education"
 England.35.d:0 "The children of Brittania are taught to embrace totalism and it’s values. However, this is not enough. Starting today, from year 1 all the way to year 12, kids will be encouraged to be apart of the Eternal revolution. If they hear a parent, a friend, or even their own teacher slandering the revolution, they are encouraged to inform their nearest official whether it’s a member of the police or their own local government."

 England.36.t:0 "Working For Blair!"

 England.37.t:0 "Building Blairs Palace"

 England.37.o1:0 "Our Leader Will Live In His Palace!"
 England.38.t:0 "England Stands Tall"

 England.40.t:0 "We Will Take Wales"
 England.40.d:0 "Dear leader comrade General Blair has spoke to his army officials today and has started to draft battle plans of how they will take Wales.

 England.40.o1:0 "Wales Will Be Ours!"
 England.41.t:0 "The Talks"
 England.41.d:0 "The most prominent leaders of Wales have asked to sit down with us and “diplomatically” discuss a way to resolve our current predicament.

 England.41.o1:0 "This Is Pointless"
 England.42.t:0 "The Talks Fail"
 England.42.d:0 "The Welsh Leaders have asked to sit down with us and try to find a diplomatic way to resolve this matter. It seems they are scared and wish to prevent war and invasion. Unfortunately, they wish for us to stay away from Wales. That isn’t an option.\n\nTHE LEADERS WILL NOT LEAVE US ALONE! THEY BEG AND PLEAD, “THINK OF THE INNOCENT LIVES THAT COULD BE LOST”. We just looked and shook our heads, its obvious they are weak and need to adapt to a new totalist life. Its decided, Wales will be ours and we will train the Welsh people to no longer fear death. "
 England.42.o1:0 "Were Done With This."
 England.43.t:0 "Take The Dragons Head"
 England.43.d:0 "General Blair has given the thumbs up, its war. After nearly 70 years of peace, the union has finally reached a point where it is now ready to shed blood again. The army has begun to walk through the hills of the English border and fired at the border walls on the Welsh side. As guard towers collapsed and the Welsh soldiers tried to fire at us, it seemed that already the war was turning against them. Our soldiers opened fire as union fighter jets roared over the skies of Wales."
 England.43.o1:0 "Its Time To Unite The Union."
 England.44.t:0 "Wales Has Fallen"
 England.44.d:0 "The war as predicated was short and a strong easy win. Once we marched into the city of Cardiff the Welsh Ministry started peace talks and finally agreed a transfer of power. The Welsh State will for now become a temporary transitional state until we have rebuilt the state and we are ready to bring the state of Wales under the totalist banner. Some rebel groups have tried to fight back but their fighting as been put down quick. General Blair has been heard to have celebrated by asking for some Welsh people to be brought to his palace and shot at while he watches and drinks with his generals."
 England.44.o1:0 "We Finally Take The Dragon."
 England.45.t:0 "Down Goes The Flag"
 England.45.d:0 "The red dragon and the Welsh flag will now be icons of an illegal protest and anyone who waves those will be arrested. Now the new flag has been raised of the cities in Wales as streets and towns slowly begin to transform into totalist propaganda with the sword and hammer being featured over advertisement boards and images of General Blair being put on display in cities. Already cinemas are showing movies about the U.S.B.R and life of our great leader."
 England.45.o1:0 "The Removal Of Welsh Nationalism Begins."
 England.46.t:0 "The Trials Of Wales"
 England.46.d:0 "Blair promised no harm would come to the Welsh politicians and would have free passage to leave for Ireland. As they waited at Swansea harbour about to bord a passenger ship, union agents came and quickly arrested them, the leaders shouting their demands as they were told they were allowed to be freed! Once captured they were taken away to London, not long after staged trails had taken place. Each leader admitted their crimes against the USBR and begged for forgiveness. Within minutes the jury had decided their fate, each one was to be founded guilty with either the option of being hung by the neck or shot by firing squad."
 England.46.o1:0 "The End Of Welsh Influence"
 England.47.t:0 "Uniting Wales"
 England.47.d:0 "General Blair has spoken on the border of the Welsh and English lands, he has ordered for the border fences to be removed and the state of Wales to no longer become a separate land but to be known as “England”. As the general put it “Wales shall no longer exist in our vocabulary, There will only be England and that is it, no more with the people of our conquered land identify themselves as Welsh, Only English”."
 England.47.o1:0 "The End Of Wales"
 England.48.t:0 "The Great Defeat"
 England.48.d:0 "It seems the Welsh were bluffing when they asked us to stop. Once our soldiers crossed into the borders of Wales they were gunned down instantly, the training given to our men and woman had failed as they were completely unprepared. Jets were easily shot out the sky, only weapons from Canada and the US could have done this, it seems the dirty capitalists had been working the whole time with the Welsh and were preparing them for years for this moment. Blair has ordered any man, woman or child who has fled from the battlefield to be shot in the streets and be shown as a moment that the U.S.B.R will never forget!"
 England.48.o1:0 "The End Of Wales"
 England.49.t:0 "Kill The Runners"
 England.49.d:0 "Many soldiers were apparently not ready to fight for the revolution, and so they deserted. No more will this be tolerated. Let it be known that those who desert the military will be executed next to their families in T.E. Lawrence Square. We do not care for age, gender, or position, by deserting you have committed the ultimate treason against their nation."
 England.49.o1:0 "Traitors."
 England.50.t:0 "Wales Will Pay"
 England.50.d:0 "Fireworks lit up the skies on the Welsh border as they have successfully repealed the war against the U.S.B.R. News of soldiers and even officers escaping onto the Welsh side has reached Blair as Agents try to sneak in and kill the traitors. Now is the time for complete reform and rebuilt, we will be back Wales and we will take your land. Just like you took our soldiers."
 England.50.o1:0 "Damn The Welsh!"
 England.51.t:0 "The Wrath Of General Blair"
 England.51.d:0 "Comrade Blair, the man who promised a return to English glory and supremacy has become the laughing stock of the world. To combat this, General Blair has ordered “Unspecified searches” of homes suspected of dissidents. If they were found to be watching international broadcasts, or reading prohibited books, or even listening to any music that’s not approved by the ministry of culture, then these families were deported off to work camps or shot in the streets."
 England.51.o1:0 "The People Will Learn!"
 England.52.t:0 "The Border Visit"
 England.52.d:0 "General Blair has visited the border of Wales to see exactly what caused the defeat of the army and where it went wrong as well as how they could of overcome the imperialists weaponry being fired upon them. Once he reached the guard tower on the English side he turned to his second in Command, Dermot Hudson who heard a loud bang. Looking at each other Blair fell to the floor holding his chest, blood started to drip through his hand as they began to realise what had happened. A union soldier who escaped onto the Welsh side during the war managed to steal a sniper rifle and fire at Bair, quickly escaping back deep into the Welsh forests. Blair was airlifted to a hospital close by but once there no matter what the doctors did, it was too late, General Blair was dead."
